<h2 class="pcap" id="c1">A New Park is Born</h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pmg004.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="202" />
</div>
<p>On September 12, 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed
an act of Congress establishing Canyonlands as our thirty-second
national park, the first addition to the park system since
1956.</p>
<p>The birth of Canyonlands National Park was not without
labor pains. In the 1930&rsquo;s virtually all the vast canyon country
between Moab, Utah, and Grand Canyon, Ariz., was studied for
a projected Escalante National Park. But Escalante failed to get
off the ground, even when a second attempt was made in the
1950&rsquo;s. Not until another proposal had been made and legislative
compromises had been worked out did the park materialize, this
time under a new name&mdash;Canyonlands. Among the many
dignitaries who witnessed the signature on September 12 was
one of the men most responsible for the park&rsquo;s creation, park
superintendent Bates E. Wilson, who did the pioneer spade work
in the field.</p>
<p>The newborn park covered 400 square miles<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
at the junction of
the Green and Colorado Rivers in Utah. It included such
magnificent features as Island in the Sky, The Needles,
Upheaval Dome, and the two great stone formations, Angel
Arch and Druid Arch. On November 16, 1971, President Richard
M. Nixon signed an act of Congress enlarging the park by 125
square miles in four separate parcels of land, so the area now
totals 525 square miles, all in southeastern Utah, as shown on
the map (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>). The northern boundary was extended to include
parts of Taylor and Shafer Canyons. The addition at the
southeast corner takes in the headwaters of Salt and Lavender
Canyons and part of Davis&rsquo; Canyon. The largest addition, at the
southwest corner, includes grotesquely carved areas bearing
such colorful names as The Maze, Land of Standing Rocks, The
Fins, The Doll House (<a href="#fig36">fig. 36</a>), and Ernies Country (named after
Ernie Larson, an early-day sheepman). The fourth parcel lies
about 8 miles west of the northwest corner and encompasses
much of Horseshoe Canyon, whose walls are adorned by striking
pictographs (<a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>At this writing (1973) the park is still in its infancy, with most
of the planned developments and improvements awaiting time
and money, but a good start has been made. In 1960 my family
and I first traversed Island in the Sky to Grand View Point over
a rough jeep trail; now it is reached with ease over a good graded
road which eventually will be paved. A temporary trailer-housed
entrance station near The Neck will be replaced by permanent
headquarters for the Island in the Sky district after water is
piped up from wells drilled near the mouth of Taylor Canyon.</p>
<p>In August 1965, when the Park was but 11 months old, we
drove the family car over a two-track dirt &ldquo;road&rdquo; from Dugout
Ranch to Cave Spring&mdash;temporary headquarters for the Needles
district of the park, whose personnel were housed partly in
trailers and partly in the cave. Now a modern paved highway,
built by the State (Utah Highway 11) for 19 miles to Dugout
Ranch and by San Juan County, the State of Utah, and the
National Park Service for the next 18 miles, extends a total of 38
miles from U.S. Highway 163 to a new modern campground at
Squaw Flat (<a href="#fig39">fig. 39</a>). The entrance station and housing for park
personnel are now in trailers about 2 miles west of Cave Spring,
but the trailers will be replaced by permanent structures. A
shallow well near temporary headquarters supplies the only
water available to the campground 1.5 miles to the west, but a
new supply is to be developed for the campground and permanent
headquarters. Groceries, gasoline, trailer hookups, and
charter flights are available at Canyonlands Resort, just outside
the eastern park boundary. The old cowboy line camp at Cave
Spring has been restored so that visitors can see this phase of
colorful Canyonlands history (<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>). Except for 2&frac12; miles of
partly graded road west from Squaw Flat, all travel to the west
and south is by four-wheel-drive vehicle or on foot. In order to
reach the confluence of the Green and Colorado Rivers, The
Grabens, and Chesler and Virginia Parks, drivers must conquer
formidable Elephant Hill, with its 40 percent grades and backup
switchbacks. SOB Hill and the Silver Stairs also tax the skill and
patience of jeepsters. Parts of this area will eventually be
reached by graded roads, possibly by about 1977, but many hope
that much of it will be kept accessible only by jeep or foot trails.</p>
<p>Bates Wilson, recently retired superintendent not only of
Canyonlands National Park but also of nearby Arches National
Park and of Natural Bridges National Monument about 80 miles
to the south, is one of the few men in the park service who has
guided a national park through all phases&mdash;location, promotion,
establishment, and initial development. He retired in June 1972
to a ranch along the Colorado River north of Moab.</p>

<p>Unless credited to others, for which grateful acknowledgment
is made, the color photographs were taken by me. Most of these
were taken on 4- by 5-inch film in a tripod-mounted press
camera using lenses of several focal lengths, but a few were
taken on 35-millimeter film. Unless credited to others, the black

<div class="img">
<img src="images/pmg006.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="224" />
</div>
<p>Although Major John Wesley Powell was not the first
geologist to view the canyon lands, his two daring boat trips
down the Green and Colorado Rivers in 1869 and 1871 made
history by bringing to light the first descriptions of the
geography and geology of what was then the largest remaining
uncharted wilderness in the United States. Many landmarks
along the canyons in the park were named by Powell and his
men during those explorations. J. S. Newberry is thought to
have been the first geologist to view the canyon lands&mdash;at least
he seems to have been the first one whose observations were
recorded (1861), but the more comprehensive findings of Powell
(1875) were the ones that made history.</p>
<p>The 100th anniversary of Major Powell&rsquo;s pioneer exploration
of the Green and Colorado Rivers was commemorated in 1969 by
a national centennial sponsored jointly by the U.S. Department
of the Interior, the Smithsonian Institution, the National
Geographic Society, and many other organizations. This touched
off many magazine and newspaper articles, several commemorative
programs and dedications, and several publications
of lasting interest. Noteworthy among the latter is U.S.
Geological Survey Professional Paper 669 entitled &ldquo;The Colorado
River Region and John Wesley Powell.&rdquo; Of its four separate
parts, two are of special interest to our Canyonlands story: part
A, &ldquo;John Wesley Powell: Pioneer Statesman of Federal Science,&rdquo;
by Rabbitt (1969) and part C, &ldquo;Geologic History of the Colorado
River,&rdquo; by Hunt (1969). An interesting history of the National
Park Service by Everhart (1972) was published as part of the
national park centennial effort. The Powell Society, Ltd., of
Denver, Colo., was founded mainly to publish four &ldquo;River
Runners&rsquo; Guides to the Canyons of the Green and Colorado
Rivers, with Emphasis on Geologic Features,&rdquo; covering five
reaches of the two rivers from Flaming Gorge Dam, Utah, to
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
Grand Canyon, Ariz. One of these by Mutschler (1969) covers
Labyrinth, Stillwater, and Cataract Canyons, all in
Canyonlands National Park. Another guidebook by Baars and
Molenaar (1971) covers the Colorado River from about Potash,
Utah, to the confluence with the Green, and Cataract Canyon. It
is difficult to realize that thousands of people annually now boat
down the canyons Powell dared to explore without knowledge of
the dangers that lay ahead.</p>
<p>During the summer of 1968 a U.S. Geological Survey expedition
led by Eugene M. Shoemaker retraced the historic 1869 and
1871 river voyages of Major Powell, in order to reoccupy the
camera stations of the 1871 voyage and rephotograph the same
scenes nearly 100 years later. Remarkably enough, about 150
camera stations were recovered, many requiring considerable
search, and official photographer Hal G. Stephens
rephotographed the scenes taken with cumbersome wet-plate
cameras nearly 100 years earlier by E. O. Beaman (above the site
of Lees Ferry) and by J. K. Hillers (below the site). A report containing
these remarkable sets of before and after photographs
hopefully will be published eventually as a delayed part of the
Powell centennial. A few pairs have been published by others
(Baars and Molenaar, 1971, p. 90-99), and two pairs are shown
herein as figures <a href="#fig62">62</a> and <a href="#fig67">67</a>. As these photographs show, in most
places the rocks and even the vegetation remain virtually unchanged
after nearly a century, but a few other pairs not included
herein show catastrophic changes resulting from local
floods or rockfalls.</p>

<p>On June 26, 1969, state and local officials met along the Green
River at the mouth of Split Mountain Canyon, in Dinosaur
National Monument, to dedicate a monument to Major Powell,
commemorating the 100th anniversary of his first river trip, and
to dedicate the Powell Centennial Scenic Drive, also known as
the Powell Memorial Highway. In the absence of any roads
closely paralleling the Green and Colorado Rivers except for
short distances, this route is virtually the only means of approach
to the rivers and comprises parts of several state and
federal highways connecting Green River, Wyo., and Grand Canyon,
Ariz. A segment of it, U.S. Highway 163, connects Crescent
Junction, Moab, Monticello, and Blanding, all in Utah, and
provides the principal access routes to Canyonlands and Arches
National Parks and Natural Bridges National Monument.</p>
<p>The ceremonies at the mouth of Split Mountain Canyon began
with the landing of the official party flotilla of four boats similar
to the ones used 100 years earlier by Powell, who was impersonated
by a bearded man dressed to resemble the one-armed
major. After the dedication, the four boats resumed the voyage
down the Green River for another ceremony.</p>
<p>On June 29 a second monument was dedicated at the head of
Desolation Canyon, some 50 miles southwest of Vernal, Utah,
where the 1869 Powell expedition first ventured into the then
unknown wilderness. The bronze plaque identifies Desolation Canyon,
named by Powell, as a national historic landmark that
comprises 58,000 acres in an area 1 mile wide on each side of a
95-mile reach of the Green River.</p>

<h3 id="c4">Prehistoric people</h3>
<p>There is abundant evidence that the canyon lands were inhabited
by cliff dwellers centuries before the explorations of
Powell or the earlier visits of the Spanish explorers and the fur
trappers. Projectile points and other artifacts found in the nearby
La Sal and Abajo Mountains indicate occupation by
aborigines from about 3,000-2,000 B.C. to about 1 A.D. (Hunt,
1956).</p>
<p>Archeologists have found evidence of two occupations by
prehistoric peoples in and near Canyonlands National Park&mdash;the
Fremont people around 850 or 900 A.D. and the Pueblo or
Anasazi people from about 1075 to their departure in the late
12th century (Jennings, 1970). Within the park, the most densely
populated area was along Salt Canyon and its tributaries in
the Needles district, but many prehistoric dwellings and
granaries are also found just south of the park in Beef Basin and
Ruin Park.</p>
<p>The Fremont people, who were mainly hunters, seemingly left
no artifacts, but they did leave beautiful pictographs, or rock
paintings, such as the group of ghostly human figures on the
sandstone wall of Horseshoe Canyon (<a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>), in the detached unit
northwest of the park proper (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>). The All American Man
(<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>), a most unusual &ldquo;Humpty Dumpty&rdquo; figure painted in red,
white, and blue on the wall of a cave about 3&#8531; miles above the
cable across the east fork of Salt Canyon, is believed to have
been done in the Fremont style, but as shown in the photograph,
it is next to one of three dwellings in the same cave that were
built later by the Anasazi people. Tower Ruin (<a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>) is one of
many well-preserved granaries built by the Anasazi, who
farmed the flood plains of creeks such as Salt and Horse
Canyons. According to Jennings (1970),</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is some evidence that these early Utah people practiced a form of irrigation,
using shallow ditches to carry water to their crops. There is also evidence
that a change in climate sometime around the late 12th century brought about
summer flash flooding and induced the cliff dwellers to abandon their
Canyonlands homes and farms.</p>

<p>Visitors to the Needles district pass through Indian Creek
State Park 12 miles west of U.S. Highway 163. The principal attraction,
which is visible at the base of the Wingate Sandstone
cliff on the right (north), is Newspaper Rock (<a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>), one of the
best preserved and most intriguing petroglyphs, or rock inscriptions,
in the canyon lands. Many of the older cliff faces of the
Wingate and Navajo Sandstones are darkened or blackened by
desert varnish, a natural pigment of iron and manganese oxides.
The prehistoric inhabitants of the canyon country learned that
effective and enduring designs could be created simply by chiseling
through the thin dark layer to reveal the buff or tan
sandstone beneath. According to Jesse D. Jennings (letter of
Mar. 20, 1962, to Utah Div. Parks and Recreation),</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are at least three periods of workmanship visible on the rock. The last is
quite recent since it shows men mounted on horses [brought in by Spanish explorers].
These are probably less than 200 years old and are probably the work of
Ute tribesmen. The others cannot be identified with any specific cultural group,
although the earliest may be as much as one thousand years old and are probably
the work of the so-called &ldquo;Fremont&rdquo; peoples * * *</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to the designs by the Fremont, Anasazi, and Ute artists,
you will note a few names and dates as late as 1954.</p>

<p>The modern history of Canyonlands is as colorful as the
canyons themselves, and involves Indians, cattlemen, bank
robbers, cattle rustlers, and horsethieves, followed by oil
drillers, uranium hunters, potash miners, jeepsters, boaters,
and tourists. A brief summary of their activities is taken mainly
from a recent account by Maxine Newell (1970), to whose work
you are referred for further details.</p>
<p>Bands of Ute and Navajo Indians roamed the canyons and
mesas until the late 1800&rsquo;s, but gradually they were driven out
and succeeded by pioneer cattlemen, the first of whom were
George and Silas Green in 1874-75, followed by the Taylor
brothers in 1880-81. Cowboys named many of the natural
features of the area, and the Needles country provided the scenic
background for some of Zane Grey&rsquo;s western tales and for David
Lavender&rsquo;s &ldquo;One Man&rsquo;s West.&rdquo; Lavender Canyon, whose
headwaters were recently annexed to the park, was named for
him. Visitors to the Needles district pass the Dugout Ranch
about 7 miles northwest of Newspaper Rock. The earliest ranch
dwellings were dirt houses built by the Somerville and Scorup
brothers, who bought the huge Indian Creek spread for $426,000
from the Carlisle Co. in 1918. In 1973 the ranch was operated by
Robert and Heidi Redd, whose line camp at Cave Spring served
as temporary park headquarters and later was restored to a
typical line camp (<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>) as part of the Cave Spring Environmental
Trail.</p>
<p>Robbers Roost Canyon and Spring some 30 miles west of the
park was the hangout of a horsethief named Cap Brown in the
seventies. From 1884 until about 1900 it was the hiding place for
the notorious Butch Cassidy and his Wild Bunch, who robbed
banks, trains, and mine payrolls and stole or traded horses and
cattle from the ranchers. Cassidy and his gang managed to get
along with the cattlemen by either replacing or paying for most
of the horses and cattle, but the law finally drove them out, and
Butch, the Sundance Kid, and a woman named Etta Place
moved to Bolivia. According to the movie version, Butch and the
Sundance Kid were hunted down and shot by Bolivian soldiers
for robbing banks and mine payrolls, but according to Baker
(1971) Butch returned safely to the United States and died in the
Northwest in 1943 or 1944, and the Sundance Kid is reported to
have died in Casper, Wyo., in 1958 at age 98. Art Ekker (Findley,
1971, <a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>), present owner of Robbers Roost Ranch, which contains
the former hangout, commented: &ldquo;A lot of people are sure
that Butch and his gang buried some money around Robbers
Roost. Every so often somebody turns up with a map or a metal
detector and wants to start digging. They&rsquo;ve found a lot of rusty
tin cans and old horseshoes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The uranium boom of the 1950&rsquo;s, touched off by Charlie
Steen&rsquo;s fabulous Mi Vida mine south of La Sal, Utah, temporarily
skyrocketed the population of Moab and sent uranium
hunters into every nook and cranny of the canyon lands. Many
of the jeep trails were first made then, and landing strips and
prospect holes of that period are plentiful. Most of the prospects
were in the Chinle Formation, particularly in the Moss Back
Member at the base, but some were in rocks older than the Chinle,
and some were in younger rocks. The uranium mines in the
park are no longer operating, but production has been resumed
in a few mines just north and east of the park. Information on
some of these mines, obtained from E. P. Beroni (U.S. Atomic
Energy Comm., oral commun., Feb. 14, 1973) is given at appropriate
places below.</p>
<p>The number of boaters or floaters on the Colorado and Green
Rivers is increasing steadily, and trips by jet boat and other
power boats are available from Moab. Tourist travel over good
roads on Island in the Sky and Hatch Point and by paved road to
The Needles also is increasing steadily. Travel west of the Green
River and main stem of the Colorado River is still restricted
largely to a few jeep trails and to hiking or horseback riding.</p>

</div>
<p>Geologists have divided the United States into many
provinces, each of which has distinctive geologic and
topographic characteristics that set it apart from the others.
One of the most intriguing and scenic of these is the Colorado
Plateaus province, referred to in this report simply as the
Colorado Plateau, or the Plateau. This province, which covers
some 150,000 square miles and is not all plateaus, as we shall
see, extends from Rifle, Colo., at the northeast to a little beyond
Flagstaff, Ariz., at the southwest and from Cedar City, Utah, at
the west nearly to Albuquerque, N. Mex., at the southeast.
Canyonlands National Park appropriately occupies the heart of
the Canyon Lands section, one of the six subdivisions of the
Plateau. As the names imply, the Canyon Lands section of the
Plateau comprises a high plateau, generally ranging in altitude
from 5,000 to 7,000 feet, which has been intricately dissected by
literally thousands of canyons.</p>
<p>Canyonlands National Park is drained entirely by the
Colorado and Green Rivers, whose confluence is an important
and scenic central feature of the park (figs. <a href="#fig59">59</a>, <a href="#fig60">60</a>). Individual
canyons traversed or drained by these rivers are discussed in
later chapters.</p>
<p>When Major Powell reached the confluence in 1869, the river
flowing in from the northeast to join the Green River was called
the Grand River, and the Green and Grand joined there to form
the Colorado River. The Grand River was renamed Colorado
River by act of the Colorado State Legislature approved March
24, 1921, and by act of Congress approved July 25, 1921. But the
old term still remains in names such as Grand County, Colo., the
headwaters region; Grand Valley, a town 16 miles west of Rifle,
Colo.; Grand Valley between Palisade and Mack, Colo.; Grand
Mesa, which towers more than a mile above the Grand and Gunnison
River valleys; Grand Junction, Colo., a city appropriately
located at the confluence of the Grand and Gunnison Rivers;
Grand County, Utah, which the river traverses after entering
Utah; and Grand View Point, the southern terminus of Island in
the Sky.</p>

<p>When viewed at a distance of 1 foot, the shaded relief map

Canyonlands National Park to the same horizontal scale as it
would appear to a person in a spacecraft flying at a height of
250,000 feet, or about 48 miles. This map was prepared by artist
John R. Stacy from parts of the reverse sides of four plastic
relief maps<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a>&mdash;Salina, Moab, Cortez, and Escalante quadrangles,

<h2 class="pcap" id="c7">Rocks and Landforms</h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/pmg021.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="224" />
</div>
<p>The vivid and varied colors of the bare rocks and the fantastic
canyons, buttes, spires, columns, alcoves, caves, arches, and
other erosional forms of the canyon country result from a fortuitous
combination of geologic and climatic circumstances and
events unequaled in most other parts of the world.</p>
<p>First among these events was the piling up, layer upon layer,
of thousands of feet of sedimentary rocks under a wide variety
of environments. Sedimentary rocks of the region are composed
of particles ranging in size from clay and silt through sand and
gravel carried to their resting places by moving water, silt and
sand particles transported by wind, and some materials
precipitated from water solutions, such as limestone (calcium
carbonate), dolomite (calcium and magnesium carbonate), gypsum
(calcium sulfate with some water), anhydrite (calcium sulfate
alone), common salt (sodium chloride), potash minerals
such as potassium chloride, and a few other less common types.
Some of the materials were laid down in shallow seas that once
covered the area (<a href="#fig8">fig. 8</a>) or in lagoons and estuaries near the sea.
Some beds were deposited by streams in inland basins or plains,
a few were deposited in lakes, and some, like the Navajo
Sandstone, were carried in by the wind. The character and
thickness of the sedimentary rocks, and the names and ages
assigned to them by geologists, are shown in the rock column in
<a href="#fig9">figure 9</a> and in the cross sections in figures <a href="#fig10">10</a> and <a href="#fig15">15</a>, and the
history of their deposition is discussed in the chapter &ldquo;Summary
of Geologic History.&rdquo; The rock column was compiled mainly
from generalized stratigraphic sections given by Baker (1933,
1946), McKnight (1940), Hinrichs and others (1967, 1971b), and
F. A. McKeown and P. P. Orkild (U.S. Geol. Survey, unpub.
data, Mar. 16, 1973).</p>
<p>Not exposed in the area but present far beneath the sedimentary
cover, and exposed in a few surrounding places, are examples
of the other two principal types of rocks: (1) igneous
rocks, solidified from molten rock forced into or above younger
rocks along cracks, joints, and faults and (2) much older
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
metamorphic rocks, formed from other pre-existing rock types
by great heat and pressure at extreme depths. The particles
comprising the sedimentary rocks were derived by weathering
and erosion of rocks of all three types in the headwater regions
of the ancestral Colorado River basin. Igneous rocks of Tertiary
Age (<a href="#fig80">fig. 80</a>) form the nearby La Sal, Abajo, and Henry Mountains
(<a href="#fig7">fig. 7</a>).</p>

<p class="pcap">SHALLOW INLAND SEA which covered Canyonlands and vicinity during Middle Pennsylvanian
time. (Fig. 8)</p>
</div>
<p>Second among the main events leading to the formation of the
canyon country was the raising and buckling of the Plateau by
earth forces so that it could be vigorously attacked by various
forces of erosion and so that the rock materials thus pried loose
or dissolved could eventually be carted away to the Gulf of
California by the ancestral Colorado River. Some idea of the
enormous volume of rock thus removed is apparent when you
look down some 2,000 feet to the river from any of the high
overlooks, such as Dead Horse Point (<a href="#fig15">fig. 15</a>) or Green River
Overlook (<a href="#fig23">fig. 23</a>), or when you lay a straightedge across the
three high mesas in <a href="#fig10">figure 10</a> and note the large volume of missing
rocks below. Not so apparent, however, is the fact that some
10,000 feet of younger Mesozoic and Tertiary rocks that once
overlay this high plateau also has been swept away. In all, the
river has carried thousands of cubic miles of sediment to the sea
and is still actively at work on this gigantic earthmoving project.
In an earlier report (Lohman, 1965, p. 42) I estimated that the
rate of removal may have been as great as about 3 cubic miles
each century. For a few years the bulk of it was dumped into
Lake Mead, but now Lake Powell is getting much of it. When
these and other reservoirs ultimately become filled with sediment,
for reservoirs and lakes are but temporary things, the
Gulf of California will again become the burial ground.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Last but far from least among the factors responsible for the
grandeur of the canyon country is the desert climate, which
allows us to see virtually every foot of the vividly colored naked
rocks and has made possible the creation and preservation of
such a wide variety of fantastic sculptures. A wetter climate
would have produced a far different and smoother landscape in
which most of the rocks and land forms would have been hidden
by vegetation. In the canyon lands the vegetation is mainly on
the high mesas and on the narrow flood plains bordering the
rivers, but scanty vegetation does grow on the gentle slopes or
flats.</p>
<p>The desert climate has combined with the nearly flat lying
layers of sediments of different character, hardness, and
thickness to produce steep slopes having many cliffs and ledges
and generally sharp to angular edges rather than the subdued
rounded forms of more humid regions. This has led geologists to
refer to such terrain as having &ldquo;layer-cake geology,&rdquo; and this is
brought out by the profile in the rock column (<a href="#fig9">fig. 9</a>), by the
cross section (<a href="#fig10">fig. 10</a>), by <a href="#fig15">figure 15</a>, and by many of the other
photographs. But the baker of this cake was rather
careless&mdash;not only do the layers range widely in thickness and
character, but some are wedge shaped, thick on one side of the
cake but thin or absent on the other. Then too, when he ran out
of icing in the midst of a layer, he was apt to finish with a
different kind or color, for no inspector was on the job to insure
orderly construction.</p>
<p>If all the rock strata in the park were present at one locality,
their sequence and thickness would be those shown on the right-hand
side of the graphic section in <a href="#fig9">figure 9</a>. However, because of
the lateral changes in thickness and character and the wedging
out of certain beds, such as the White Rim Sandstone Member of
the Cutler Formation, no two sections of the strata are exactly
alike. This will be brought out in photographs of different exposures
of rocks in various parts of the park.</p>
<p>An often-asked question is, why are most of the rocks so red?
This can be answered by one word&mdash;iron, the same pigment used
in rouge and in paint for barns and boxcars. Various oxides of
iron, some including water, produce not only brick red but also
pink, salmon, brown, buff, yellow, and even green or bluish
green. This does not imply that the rocks could be considered as
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
sources of iron ore, for the merest trace of iron, generally only 1
to 3 percent, is enough to produce even the darkest shades of red.
The only rocks in the park that contain virtually no iron are
white sandstones of the White Rim Sandstone Member of the
Cutler Formation (figs. <a href="#fig21">21</a>-<a href="#fig24">24</a>) and the Navajo Sandstone.</p>

via Grand View Point in middle, to Needles Overlook at east (right), showing the three
principal topographic levels and character of the rock strata. Line of section bends at
Grand View Point, which is northernmost part. (Fig. 10)</p>
</div>
<p>As pointed out by Stokes (1970, p. 3), microscopic examination
of the colored grains of quartz or other minerals shows the pigment
to be merely a thin coating on and between white or
colorless particles. Sand or silt weathered from such rocks soon
loses its color by the scouring action of wind or water, so most of
the sand dunes and sand bars are white or nearly so.</p>
<p>The map (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>) and cross section (<a href="#fig10">fig. 10</a>) of the park show
that in general the major features of the landscape lie at three
different and distinctive levels. A recently erected plaque on
Grand View Point appropriately refers to these levels as the
&ldquo;Three Worlds.&rdquo; The high plateaus, or mesas, in and adjoining
the park dominate the skyline&mdash;in fact, the central one, between
the Green and Colorado Rivers, is appropriately named Island in
the Sky. If you stand on either the east or the west shore of this
towering cliff-bordered island, you can look across a sea of fantastic
erosional forms to a similar cliff-bordered shore at about
the same level. Closer inspection of the sea of rocks on either
side shows relatively flat benches or platforms about halfway to
the bottom; below these are the generally steep sided or cliff-bordered
canyons of the two rivers and their larger tributaries.
From some vantage points along the shore, such as Dead Horse
Point (<a href="#fig15">fig. 15</a>) or Green River Overlook (<a href="#fig23">fig. 23</a>), you can see the
deepest level of all&mdash;the channels and flood plains of the Green
and Colorado Rivers.</p>
<p>What caused the &ldquo;Three Worlds&rdquo; and the formidable cliffs
supporting the high mesas or forming towering monoliths like
Angel Arch or Druid Arch (figs. <a href="#fig43">43</a>, <a href="#fig54">54</a>)? Differences in the composition,
hardness, arrangement, and thickness of the rock layers
determine their ability to withstand the forces of fracturing and
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
erosion and hence their tendency to form cliffs, ledges, or slopes.
Most of the cliff- or ledge-forming rocks are sandstones consisting
of sand grains deposited by wind or water and later
cemented together by silica (SiO&#8322;), calcium carbonate (CaCO&#8323;),
or one of the iron oxides (such as Fe&#8322;O&#8323;), but some hard, resistant
ledges are made of limestone (calcium carbonate). The rock
column (<a href="#fig9">fig. 9</a>) shows in general how these rock formations are
sculptured by erosion and how they protect underlying layers
from more rapid erosion. The nearly vertical cliffs supporting
the highest mesas consist of the well-cemented Wingate
Sandstone protected above by the even harder sandstone of the
Kayenta Formation. To borrow from an earlier report of mine
(Lohman, 1965, p. 17),</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vertical cliffs and shafts of the Wingate Sandstone endure only where the top of
the formation is capped by beds of the next younger rock unit&mdash;the Kayenta Formation.
The Kayenta is much more resistant than the Wingate, so even a few
feet of the Kayenta * * * protect the rock beneath.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In some places remnants of the overlying Navajo Sandstone
make up the topmost unit of the cliff.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/pmg027.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="220" />
</div>
<p>The question of how to see the park has no simple answer, for
the park is too vast and complex to comprehend by a quick visit
to any one of its many and varied parts or by any one means of
transportation. Some, as did Major Powell, view it only from the
rivers&mdash;by boat plus a few back-breaking climbs up the bordering
canyon walls. Others see only the small parts reachable by
passenger cars. The more venturesome see vastly more by jeep,
foot, or horseback. And a few prefer to view it as the birds
do&mdash;from the air. Many, those who put aside their magazines
long enough, get bird&rsquo;s-eye views without half trying, for
Canyonlands is beneath the principal air routes connecting Los
Angeles with Grand Junction and Denver. Actually, a full appreciation
of all the wonders and beauties of the park is possible
only by combining all these approaches and methods of locomotion,
but only a few fortunate souls such as Bates Wilson have
thus been able to inspect virtually every square foot of it.</p>
<p>The task clearly before me, then, is how best to present such a
complex wonderland to you, the reader. The method I selected,
after considerable thought and a few false starts, is to begin at
the top&mdash;the high mesas&mdash;and work my way downward much as
the rivers have done in carving out this fantastic area, to some of
the broad benchlands beneath the mesas and eventually to the
river channels and deep canyons. Although the approach I
selected may not be the best, and admittedly is but one of several
that comes to mind, I hope it gets the job done.</p>

breathtaking views of important features within the park, so
brief descriptions of them are included below. But first, let us
take a closer look at Island in the Sky.</p>
<h3 id="c10">Island in the Sky</h3>
<p>As the map (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>) shows, Island in the Sky is really a fork of a
wedge-shaped peninsula extending southward between the two
rivers. An outlier to the south named Junction Butte has already
been severed from the main peninsula by erosion and now is a
true island. (See <a href="#pic1">frontispiece</a> and <a href="#fig22">fig. 22</a>.) A large chunk of
Island in the Sky south of The Neck was about to be severed by
erosion from the main peninsula to become a true island, when
recent widening and grading of the road gave it a temporary
reprieve. When my family and I first squeaked over this narrow
neck in 1960 by jeep, furtive glances to right or left showed the
two canyons perilously close, and complete severance seemed
imminent. The road builders have staved off disaster for a few
thousand years, but ultimately the large section to the south will
become another island, and a bridge will be required to connect
it to the mainland. Its appearance from the air before the road
widening is shown in <a href="#fig11">figure 11</a>.</p>

Park Service. (Fig. 11)</p>
</div>
<p>The entrance road to Island in the Sky intersects U.S.
Highway 163 at a point 10 miles northwest of Moab, or 21 miles
southeast of Crescent Junction on Interstate Highway 70. From
U.S. 163 a paved road climbs colorful Sevenmile Canyon past
sandstone cliffs of the Wingate, Kayenta, and Navajo Formations
to reach the high mesa. There, just &ldquo;offshore&rdquo; to the
north, are anchored the &ldquo;battleships&rdquo; that guard the
island&mdash;Merrimac and Monitor Buttes (<a href="#fig12">fig. 12</a>). These landmarks
are composed of the Entrada Sandstone&mdash;the same rock
that forms Church Rock at the entrance to the Needles district
(<a href="#fig37">fig. 37</a>) and that shapes the spectacular arches in Arches
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
National Park. All three members of the Entrada (Wright and
others, 1962), as noted in the <a href="#fig12">figure 12</a> caption, are present here
as well as at Church Rock. Eleven miles from the junction with
U.S. Highway 163 a graded road to the right, called Horsethief
Trail, goes 16 miles down to the Green River, where it connects
with roads following the river both upstream and downstream.
The road upstream leads to two uranium mines in the lower part
of Mineral Canyon which were reactivated in 1972 and 1973. The
switchbacks are quite spectacular and are reminiscent of the
Shafer Trail. Three miles south of the Horsethief Trail turnoff is
a fork in the road&mdash;to the left the pavement continues to Dead
Horse Point, and straight ahead a graded road leads southward
to the Island in the Sky district of Canyonlands National Park.</p>

</div>
<p>Most of Island in the Sky has a scattered growth of pi&ntilde;on and
juniper trees, but several large flat areas, such as Grays
Pasture, contain sufficient sandy soil to support a mantle of
grass and weeds, which is used for grazing; however, grazing in
this part of the park will be discontinued in 1975.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h3 id="c11">DEAD HORSE POINT STATE PARK</h3>
<p>Let us follow the paved road from U.S. Highway 163 all the
way to Dead Horse Point, which was set aside as a state park in
1957. The park has a visitor center, museum, modern
campgrounds and picnic facilities, and piped water, which is
hauled all the way from Moab. An entrance fee of $1 permits us
to drive across the narrow neck to a parking area near the point
proper, which is protected by stone walls and is provided with a
ramada, benches, paths, and sanitary facilities. From Dead
Horse Point we get breathtaking views in several directions, including
a loop of the Colorado River called the Goose Neck, 2,000
feet nearly straight down.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">

<p class="pcap">CANE CREEK ANTICLINE, looking northeast toward the La Sal Mountains from Dead
Horse Point. Colorado River cuts across crest at middle right, above which is Anticline
Overlook. (See <a href="#fig31">fig. 31</a>.) Jeep trail and part of Shafer dome lie below. (Fig. 13)</p>
</div>
<p>How did such a magnificent viewpoint get such a macabre
name? Dead Horse Point was named for a sad but colorful
legend concerning a band of wild horses that once roamed the
high mesas. The point is really an embryo island separated from
the mainland by a narrow neck barely wide enough for the present
road. In the early cowboy days the island was used as a
natural corral in which wild mustangs were penned up behind a
short fence across the neck so that the better ones could be
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
sorted out and driven to mines in the San Juan Mountains of
Colorado. A band of horses corralled too long without water
allegedly died of thirst within sight of the river 2,000 feet below,
hence the name of the point, or at least so one version of the
story goes. Some versions allude to the wranglers as cowboys;
others, as horsethieves.</p>
<p>To the northeast we can see the Cane Creek anticline&mdash;an upward
fold of the rocks&mdash;behind which loom the La Sal Mountains
(<a href="#fig13">fig. 13</a>). A cutaway view of a typical anticline is shown in
<a href="#fig14">figure 14</a>. A better view of the Cane Creek anticline can be seen
from Anticline Overlook, as shown in <a href="#fig31">figure 31</a>. From our vantage
point at Dead Horse Point, we can see much of Hatch Point,
including Anticline Overlook, by looking east and southeast.
Spectacular views of the northern part of Canyonlands National
Park lie to the south, southwest, and east. Looking southwest
(<a href="#fig15">fig. 15</a>), we see most of the rock formations exposed in
Canyonlands&mdash;more than can be seen from any other vantage
point in or near the park. The names of the visible rock units
shown in <a href="#fig15">figure 15</a> can be compared with the complete list in the
rock column (<a href="#fig9">fig. 9</a>). Parts of Shafer dome, a &ldquo;closed&rdquo; rounded
anticline, are visible in the lower left of <a href="#fig15">figure 15</a> and in the
lower right of <a href="#fig13">figure 13</a>. Its general domelike shape is outlined
by the bluish-white Shafer limestone, a marker bed which also
caps the bench on the peninsula within the Goose Neck of the
river. This limestone, which here forms the top of the Rico Formation,
is not shown in the rock column (<a href="#fig9">fig. 9</a>) because its exposure
is limited to the Shafer dome and the Cane Creek anticline
and its name is used only locally by prospectors for oil
and gas.</p>

<p>Note that the White Rim Sandstone Member of the Cutler
Formation, referred to hereinafter simply as the White Rim
Sandstone, becomes thinner toward the right (northeast) in
<a href="#fig15">figure 15</a> but is absent entirely in <a href="#fig13">figure 13</a>, just a short distance
to the northeast. The gradual disappearance of recognizable
beds of this type toward the northeast, including the disappearance
of some limestone beds containing marine fossils,
are examples of what geologists call facies changes. Here the
changes result from the fact that while strata were being
deposited in or near ancient seas that lay to the southwest, beds
of different character were being laid down on land by streams
emanating from the northeast. This will be gone into in more
detail in discussions that accompany illustrations to follow, particularly
<a href="#fig27">figure 27</a>, <a href="#fig31">fig. 31</a>, and <a href="#fig35">fig. 35</a>.</p>
<h3 id="c12">NORTH ENTRANCE</h3>
<p>The north entrance to the Island in the Sky district of
Canyonlands National Park used to be 6 miles south of the junction
with the paved road to Dead Horse Point, but since the land
additions of November 1971, it is only 4&frac12; miles south of this
junction. A temporary trailer-housed entrance station marks
the old boundary.</p>
<h3 id="c13">SHAFER AND WHITE RIM TRAILS</h3>
<p>During the early 1950&rsquo;s a remarkable but hair-raising road
known as Shafer Trail was cut down the face of the cliffs below
The Neck to reach the C Group of uranium claims near the head
of Lathrop Canyon. It branches southward from the park road a
mile south of the new entrance, then descends in a series of
switchbacks. The aerial view (<a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a>) shows the upper trail and
The Neck before the park road was graded and widened, and a
view from near The Neck (<a href="#fig16">fig. 16</a>) shows the precipitous cliffs
the trail descends. It follows the general route of an old foot
trail.</p>

Sandstone forms lower, vertical half of cliff; lower part of road is in Chinle Formation.
(Fig. 16)</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Shafer Trail connects with the White Rim Trail, which, as the
name suggests, is built mainly on the White Rim, after which
the White Rim Sandstone was named. The White Rim Trail can
be followed northeastward to join the pavement at Potash, or it
can be followed southward along the Colorado River canyons to
Junction Butte, thence northward along Stillwater and
Labyrinth Canyons of the Green River to and beyond the
northern boundary of the park. At Horsethief Bottom, you can
leave the canyon by Horsethief Trail and rejoin the paved road
leading northward to U.S. 163. At Lathrop Canyon, 8 or 10 miles
south of where Shafer Trail meets the White Rim Trail, a branch
of the White Rim Trail leads downward to the Colorado River,
where picnic tables and sanitary facilities are provided. This is
used as a lunch stop by some boating groups.</p>
<p>Although some two-wheel-drive cars or trucks have traversed
the White Rim and Shafer Trails, they may encounter trouble
with deep sand, washouts, or fallen rocks, so four-wheel-drive
vehicles are recommended. In the summer these trails should
not be attempted without plenty of water, and two vehicles
traveling together provide an added margin of safety. All
vehicles should carry emergency equipment including a shovel,
tow chain or rope, jack, tire tools, and other necessary items.
Geologists and uranium prospectors working along the White
Rim Trail have obtained good drinking water from small springs
that flow from the base of the White Rim Sandstone in many
places (Neal Hinrichs, U.S. Geol. Survey, oral commun., Feb.
1973). After rains, runoff gathers in large potholes in the White
Rim Sandstone in some places and affords emergency drinking
water. Several such potholes filled with water are shown in
<a href="#fig17">figure 17</a>. Some potholes occur also in the Cedar Mesa Sandstone
in the Needles district.</p>
<h3 id="c14">GRAND VIEW POINT</h3>
<p>About a mile southwest of The Neck, the road crosses Grays
Pasture&mdash;the widest and flattest part of Island in the Sky. The
drive over this flat grassland yields not the slightest hint of the
awesome cliff-walled chasms on either side of the island. Some 5
miles southwest of The Neck, both the island and the road
branch like a Y. At a point 0.4 mile north of the Y, Mesa Trail
leads one-quarter mile east to Canyon Viewpoint Arch, which
frames the Colorado River canyon and the La Sal Mountains
(<a href="#fig18">fig. 18</a>). This arch, at the very top edge of the cliff, is composed
of the lower part of the Navajo Sandstone. The only other arch
of Navajo Sandstone in or near the park that I know of is the
small one shown in <a href="#fig33">figure 33</a>, but of course there may be others.</p>

(Fig. 20)</p>
</div>
<p>Let us now take the branch south of the Y and follow the
narrow crest of Grand View Point for about 6 miles to the main
overlook. About 0.9 mile south of the Y, a short walk to the west
over the lower part of the Navajo Sandstone affords a magnificent
view of Stillwater Canyon of the Green River, including
Turks Head (<a href="#fig23">fig. 23</a>, <a href="#fig24">fig. 24</a>). Half way to the point is a parking area
and overlook, from which we get a spectacular view of canyons
cutting the White Rim and of the La Sal Mountains beyond (<a href="#fig20">fig. 20</a>).
Note that the White Rim Sandstone, which forms the broad
bench appropriately named the White Rim, is here much thicker
than where seen near Dead Horse Point (<a href="#fig15">fig. 15</a>).</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Three more miles southward takes us to Grand View Point and
its nearby picnic area. Though named after the former Grand
River some 2,000 feet below, Grand View Point has a double
meaning, for we see from here a truly grand view (<a href="#fig21">fig. 21</a>)! At
our feet is spectacular Monument Basin, cut below the White
Rim into the brick-red Organ Rock Tongue of the Cutler Formation.
The White Rim Sandstone here is slightly thicker than to
the northeast (<a href="#fig20">fig. 20</a>) but thinner than to the west (<a href="#fig23">fig. 23</a>),
because it forms a wedge-shaped body that thickens westward.
In the distance southeastward are the Abajo Mountains, just
west of Monticello, Utah. The prominent projection on Hatch
Point on the left skyline is Needles Overlook, from which the
photograph in <a href="#fig27">figure 27</a> was taken. A closeup view of Monument
Basin, showing Junction Butte and Grand View Point in the

<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<h3 id="c15">GREEN RIVER OVERLOOK</h3>
<p>About a quarter mile west of the Y, a left fork of the road goes
about a mile and a half to Green River Overlook, which provides
a superb view of Stillwater Canyon of the Green River, the
Orange Cliffs beyond, and the Henry Mountains in the extreme
distance (<a href="#fig23">fig. 23</a>). Note that here the White Rim Sandstone is
much thicker than in preceding views. The prominent butte
enclosed by the loop of the river is known as Turks Head and is
better seen from the air (<a href="#fig24">fig. 24</a>). The light-colored band near the
base of the cliffs in the background of <a href="#fig24">figure 24</a> is characteristic
of the bleached upper part of the Moenkopi Formation in this
part of the park. According to F. A. McKeown and P. P. Orkild
(U.S. Geol. Survey, unpub. data, Feb. 16, 1973), petroliferous
material or odor generally occurs in this bleached zone and in
the basal beds of the Moenkopi.</p>
<p>The campground just north of Green River Overlook has no
water at this writing (1973), but water from wells in Taylor Canyon
will eventually be piped to nearby parts of Island in the
Sky.</p>
<h3 id="c16">UPHEAVAL DOME</h3>
<p>Five miles northwest of the Y we come to Upheaval Dome, one
of the most unusual geographic and geologic features of the
park. Viewed from the air (<a href="#fig25">fig. 25</a>), it resembles somewhat a
volcanic or meteor crater and has been called such by some.
Because beds of salt are known to underlie the park, some have
suggested that the salt may have thickened and welled upward
to form a salt dome, similar to domes along the Gulf Coast (Mattox,
1968). However, only 1,470 feet of salt was encountered in
an oil test just east of Upheaval Dome (Robert J. Hite, U.S. Geol.
Survey, oral commun., Feb. 13, 1973); so although salt may have
played a role, Upheaval Dome clearly is not a salt dome with
dimensions similar to the Gulf Coast types. It may be related to
a mound on the deep-seated Precambrian rocks (Joesting and
Plouff, 1958, fig. 3; Joesting and others, 1966, p. 13, 14, 17), but
the exact origin of the dome is not clear.</p>
<p>The central part has the structure of a dome, in that the strata
dip downward away from the middle. A ringlike syncline, or
downward fold in the rock layers (<a href="#fig26">fig. 26</a>), surrounds the dome,
beyond which the strata resume their nearly flat position. The
white rock in the bottom of the craterlike depression is not salt,
but jumbled large fragments of the White Rim Sandstone.
Surrounding that are slopes of the Moenkopi and Chinle Formations,
cliffs of the Wingate Sandstone, a circular bench of the
Kayenta Formation, and outer ramparts of the Navajo
Sandstone. Upheaval Canyon leads to Stillwater Canyon of the
Green River at the upper left.</p>

<p>One mile before the road ends, a well-marked foot trail leads
to the top of Whale Rock, a prominence on the Navajo Sandstone
that forms the outer ring of the dome. At the end of the road,
another foot trail ascends from the picnic area to the foot of the
Wingate Sandstone cliffs around the central part of the dome.
The views of the dome from these trails are interesting, but you
are really too close to get a true picture of the unusual feature,
which is obtainable only from the air, as shown in <a href="#fig25">figure 25</a>.</p>
<p>Just west of Upheaval Dome, Bighorn Mesa is connected to
Steer Mesa by a neck only 15 feet wide flanked by 300-foot vertical
cliffs, as pointed out by McKnight (1940, p. 12). I later
learned from Ed McKnight (oral commun., June 6, 1973) that
during his field work in this area in 1926 he was riding a mule
across this narrow neck when the half-asleep mule suddenly
became aware of the dropoff on one side and began to turn
around and head back. Ed hastily but cautiously dismounted
and led the mule across! When this neck is finally breached by
erosion, Bighorn Mesa will be just as isolated and inaccessible as
Junction Butte, now cut off from Grand View Point. (See <a href="#pic1">frontispiece</a>
and <a href="#fig27">fig. 27</a>.)</p>
<h3 id="c17">Hatch Point</h3>
<p>The high mesa east of Canyonlands National Park and the
Colorado River canyons, called Hatch Point, contains several
vantage points ideally suited for viewing scenic features of the
park and adjacent areas. Hatch Point is part of the vast public
domain administered by the Bureau of Land Management&mdash;a
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
sister agency of the Geological Survey and the National Park
Service, all in the U.S. Department of the Interior. The Bureau,
hereinafter referred to simply as the B.L.M., has made many
improvements on Hatch Point, including fine roads, two modern
campgrounds with sanitary facilities and piped water from
wells, and two overlooks with protective fences, benches, paths,
sanitary facilities, and ramadas containing panels that describe
the features visible from the viewpoints. Because of these improvements,
the B.L.M. has appropriately named this area &ldquo;Canyon
Rims Recreation Area.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Geologically, Hatch Point is similar to Island in the Sky. Both
are bordered by towering cliffs of the Wingate Sandstone capped
by the resistant Kayenta Formation, and rounded remnants of
the overlying Navajo Sandstone rise above the otherwise-flat
mesa surface in many places.</p>
<p>Access to this high tableland is by a good paved road leading
west from U.S. Highway 163 at a point 32 miles south of Moab
and 22 miles north of Monticello. About 5 miles west of the
highway we pass Windwhistle Campground, nestled in an attractive
cove of Entrada Sandstone cliffs, and 16 miles from the
highway we reach an intersection. From here it is 7 miles west
by paved road to Needles Overlook, 10 miles north to Anticline
Overlook. Like the other high mesas, Hatch Point contains
peripheral areas of scattered pi&ntilde;on and juniper trees and large
flat grasslands used for grazing. Grain tanks here and there
store winter feed for the cattle.</p>
<h3 id="c18">NEEDLES OVERLOOK</h3>
<p>Let us follow the pavement to Needles Overlook, from which
fine morning views of Canyonlands National Park can be seen to
the south and west. Northwestward (<a href="#fig27">fig. 27</a>) we look 10 miles
across the Colorado River canyon to Junction Butte and Grand
View Point. (This view is along the line of the east half of the
cross section in <a href="#fig10">fig. 10</a>.) The feather edge of the White Rim
Sandstone caps the White Rim west of the Colorado River, but
the White Rim is absent on the east side of the canyon and in the
entire Needles district to the southwest, where the important
scenic features are carved from the underlying Cedar Mesa
Sandstone Member of the Cutler Formation, referred to
hereinafter simply as the Cedar Mesa Sandstone. Both these
sandstones are missing in the foreground of <a href="#fig27">figure 27</a>&mdash;their
place being taken by thin beds of red siltstone, mudstone, and
sandstone similar to those that comprise the Organ Rock Tongue
shown between the two sandstones in <a href="#fig22">figure 22</a>. These are additional
examples of facies changes mentioned earlier (<a href="#Page_34">p. 34</a>).</p>

<h3 id="c19">CANYONLANDS OVERLOOK</h3>
<p>Turning north from the intersection 7 miles east of Needles
Overlook, we traverse a nearly flat grassy tableland to Hatch
Point Campground. In <a href="#fig1">figure 1</a> the campground is shown west of
the old road; the new road is west of the campground, but no
map of the new route was available for plotting in <a href="#fig1">figure 1</a>.
About a mile before we reach the campground a jeep trail heads
west then northwest about 5&frac12; miles to Canyonlands Overlook, a
scant mile from, but some 1,400 feet above, the eastern border of
Canyonlands National Park. This overlook affords fine views of
the Colorado River canyons and the eastern shore of Island in
the Sky, but at present (1973) there are no plans to improve the
trail for passenger-car travel.</p>
<p>Two miles north of the campground we cross a minor drainage
leading northeastward into the north fork of Trough Springs
Canyon. The B.L.M. plans a road down this canyon to Kane
Springs Canyon, 1,100 feet below, where it will connect both
with a scenic drive to Moab, the lower part of which is paved,
and with the jeep trail going west over Hurrah Pass (<a href="#fig30">fig. 30</a>) and
thence south along the eastern benches of the canyons of the
Colorado River to the Needles district of the park. E. Neal
Hinrichs (U.S. Geol. Survey, oral commun. Feb. 16, 1973)
reported specimens of blue celestite (strontium sulfate, SrSO&#8324;)
and barite (barium sulfate, BaSO&#8324;) in the Cutler Formation at a
point where a sharp bend of this jeep trail crosses a fault, or
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
fracture (<a href="#fig56">fig. 56</a>), in the northeast fork of Lockhart Canyon
(shown in <a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a> as the easternmost loop of the trail about 6 miles
northeast of Lockhart Basin). Farther south, the trail swings
west of Lockhart Basin, whose center exposes part of a syncline
(<a href="#fig28">fig. 28</a>).</p>

<h3 id="c20">U-3 LOOP</h3>
<p>Two and a half miles farther north, or about 2 miles south of
Anticline Overlook, a short road leads to the west and entirely
around a small conical butte of the Navajo Sandstone. This new
circular drive has not yet been formally named and is simply
called the U-3 loop, as designated in the surveyor&rsquo;s notebook. It
affords splendid views to the west and is to be equipped with picnic
tables. Looking west (<a href="#fig29">fig. 29</a>) we see a W-shaped loop of the
Colorado River, Dead Horse Point on the right skyline, and
Island in the Sky on the distant skyline. The strata curving over
Shafer dome appear in the right middle background.</p>

<h3 id="c21">ANTICLINE OVERLOOK</h3>
<p>Two more miles takes us to Anticline Overlook for the most sublime
views in this part of the area. To the north (<a href="#fig30">fig. 30</a>) we look
across the northeast flank of the Cane Creek anticline, an upfold
of the rocks (figs. <a href="#fig13">13</a>, <a href="#fig14">14</a>). Hurrah Pass straddles the narrow wall
separating the Colorado River and its canyon at the left from
Kane Springs Canyon on the right. The Colorado River appears
again in the right background, where it leaves Moab Valley. The
Kings Bottom syncline, or downfold (<a href="#fig26">fig. 26</a>), seen in the middle
distance between the Cane Creek anticline and the Moab anticline,
exposes a wide area of the Navajo Sandstone. The ridge
on the right skyline, composed of the Entrada Sandstone, is The
Windows Section of Arches National Park, and the left skyline
shows faintly the distant Book Cliffs.</p>
<p>On the east wall of Kane Springs Canyon just to the right of
<a href="#fig30">figure 30</a> is the Atomic King mine in the Cutler Formation, from
which uranium ore has been mined at intervals during the last 2
or 3 years.</p>

<p>To the northwest (<a href="#fig31">fig. 31</a>; see also <a href="#fig13">fig. 13</a>) is a textbook example
of a rock fold&mdash;the Cane Creek anticline&mdash;laid bare by the
Colorado River cutting directly across its crest (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>). Anticlines
are noted as sources of or at least hunting grounds for oil
and gas, and this one is no exception, although production has
been relatively small and was stopped altogether in about 1963.
Some oil and gas was produced also from wells on the north
flank of Shafer dome, just beneath Dead Horse Point (figs. <a href="#fig1">1</a>,
<a href="#fig15">15</a>), but other favorable-looking structures farther south that
were tested, such as Lockhart anticline, Rustler dome, and Gibson
dome (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>), failed to yield commercial amounts (Baker,
1933, p. 80-84). Some of the colorful events in the early days of
wildcatting are noted on <a href="#Page_100">page 100</a>.</p>
<p>Exploration for oil and gas led to the discovery of potash
beneath several anticlines in eastern Utah and western
Colorado. According to Hite (1968, p. 325), the Cane Creek anticline
is underlain by about 5,200 feet of salt-bearing rocks in
the Paradox Member of the Hermosa Formation (<a href="#fig9">fig. 9</a>), of
which about 84 percent is halite (common salt, sodium chloride)
and associated potash salts (sylvite, potassium chloride). The
potash mine of Texas Gulf, Inc., is shown at the right in <a href="#fig31">figure 31</a>.
The white area to the left of the mine is waste common salt,
which is recovered with the potash salts, and the white area with
dark stripes at the left is a small part of more than 400 acres of
evaporation ponds built to separate the salts. These ponds also
can be seen from Dead Horse Point. The dark stripes are the
visible parts of plastic membranes lining the ponds. Mining of
an 11-foot bed of ore began by usual underground methods from
the bottom of a shaft 2,788 feet deep but became too difficult
because of intense and intricate folding of the salt beds. Now the
salts are being extracted by a method involving solution,
wherein river water is introduced into the former workings and
allowed to stand long enough to dissolve the salts, then the brine
is pumped out to evaporation ponds, and the valuable potash
salts are separated from the sodium salts. Closeup views of the
mine and evaporation ponds are seen in figures <a href="#fig70">70</a> and <a href="#fig71">71</a>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>As noted earlier, most of the readily recognizable thin beds,
such as the White Rim Sandstone, pinch out south of here, and
<a href="#fig31">figure 31</a> marks the northeasternmost exposure of the Shafer
limestone at the top of the Rico Formation. Northeast from here
the Rico and overlying Cutler Formation are not readily
separable and are included in the so-called Cutler Formation undifferentiated.
This land-laid unit of red sandstone, siltstone,
and shale is as much as 8,000 feet thick just southwest of the ancient
Uncompahgre highland (present Uncompahgre Plateau, in
western Colorado and eastern Utah), from which it was derived
by erosion during the Permian Period (<a href="#fig80">fig. 80</a>).</p>
<h3 id="c22">Orange Cliffs</h3>
<p>The high mesas west of Canyonlands National Park do not
form as distinct a mainland as does Hatch Point, but rather are
broken up into a maze of peninsulas and islands, as shown in
<a href="#fig1">figure 1</a>. Owing to the gentle northwestward dip of the rock
strata, the altitude of the mesas declines from about 7,000 feet in
the south to about 5,300 feet in the north and northwest, where
the whole aspect of the country becomes more rounded and subdued.
As shown on the map (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>), however, the name Orange
Cliffs is applied to much of the eastward-facing cliffs, which are
made of the Wingate Sandstone capped by the Kayenta Formation.
Remnants of the Navajo Sandstone increase in number to
the north and west, where remnants of the next two younger
rock units&mdash;the Carmel Formation and the Entrada
Sandstone&mdash;also occur. Thus, the cliff-forming units dip
downward beneath younger rocks that form the relatively flat
Green River Desert to the northwest, also referred to as the San
Rafael Desert. <a href="#fig32">Figure 32</a> is a view southeastward from The
Spur, shown on the map (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>) as the northern section of the
Orange Cliffs.</p>
<p>At present (1973), the areas west of the Green River and the
main stem of the Colorado River are the least accessible of any
in the park and in this respect have not changed much since
Butch Cassidy and his Wild Bunch roamed the area, except that
the former main horse trails are now jeep trails. A secondary
road south from the town of Green River goes past the north
side of the Horseshoe Canyon Detached Unit (figs. <a href="#fig1">1</a>, <a href="#fig2">2</a>) and connects
with another secondary road to the west, which joins Utah
Highway 24 at Temple Junction, 20 miles north of Hanksville;
near Horseshoe Canyon a jeep trail leads south to the Orange
Cliffs. Owing to blowing sand, these &ldquo;roads&rdquo; are not considered
reliable for passenger cars and are best negotiated by four-wheel-drive
vehicles or horses.</p>

<p>According to Baker (1971, p. 12), the road leading eastward
along North Point was used by the Wild Bunch in traveling to
French Spring, whence they dropped down Millard Canyon (<a href="#fig33">fig. 33</a>)
and crossed the Green River at Bonita Bend, which is just
east of Buttes of the Cross (<a href="#fig64">fig. 64</a>). They also followed the Old
Spanish Trail from the Henry Mountains eastward across the
Dirty Devil River, up North Hatch Canyon, across Sunset Pass,
and down across the Land of Standing Rocks to Spanish Bottom
on the Colorado River (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>). After crossing the river, they
followed the trail up Lower Red Lake Canyon (<a href="#fig59">fig. 59</a>) and
eastward through The Needles to Monticello.</p>

<div class="img">

</div>
<p>The White Rim, a broad benchland some 1,000-1,200 feet
below the southern half of Island in the Sky, and some of the
associated benchlands west of the Green River and between the
Colorado River and Hatch Point have already been discussed as
viewed from Island in the Sky, the White Rim Trail, or Hatch
Point. There remain for consideration several other prominent
benchlands.</p>
<h3 id="c24">The Maze and Land of Standing Rocks</h3>
<p>The Maze, an intricately carved series of canyons and gullies,
has been called a &ldquo;Thirty-square-mile puzzle in sandstone&rdquo;
(Findley, 1971, p. 71-73), and one can readily visualize a king-sized
rat struggling in vain to find a way out. The rock is the
Cedar Mesa Sandstone, which here underlies red shales beneath
the White Rim Sandstone. South of The Maze an area containing
tall spires was appropriately named by the Indians &ldquo;<i>Toom&rsquo;-pin
wu-near&rsquo; Tu-weap&rsquo;</i>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Land of Standing Rocks&rdquo; (Powell, 1875,
p. 154).</p>
<p>West of The Maze is Elaterite Basin, so named because of a
dark-brown elastic mineral resin called elaterite, which seeps
from the White Rim Sandstone. One of these seeps is shown in
<a href="#fig34">figure 34</a>, and a wedge-shaped layer of the sandstone is shown in
<a href="#fig35">figure 35</a>. In the Range Canyon area shown in <a href="#fig35">figure 35</a>, sand
was being laid down in an offshore bar at the left, while red silts
and muds were being deposited on land to the right. The dark
bed just above the White Rim near the middle of the photograph
is the Hoskinnini Tongue of the Moenkopi Formation, which intertongues
with and pinches out in beds of the Moenkopi Formation
to left. These are excellent examples of what geologists call
facies changes.</p>
<p>South of the Land of Standing Rocks are equally colorful
areas known as The Fins and Ernies Country (named after Ernie
Larson, an early-day sheep man). A prominent row of spires
near Cataract Canyon is known as The Doll House (<a href="#fig36">fig. 36</a>).</p>

<h3 id="c25">The Needles district</h3>
<p>The Needles district is currently (1973) the most highly
developed part of the unfinished park as the result of design, not
accident, for this district includes the greatest number and
widest variety of spectacular features&mdash;The Needles proper, The
Grabens (pronounced gr&auml;b&#477;ns), colossal arches and other
erosional forms, large meadows such as Squaw Flat and Chesler
and Virginia Parks, a wide variety of prehistoric ruins and pictographs,
and Confluence Overlook for viewing the joining of
two mighty rivers&mdash;the Green and the Colorado. Like the White
Rim and The Maze, the Needles district is another of the broad
benchlands about midway between the high mesas and the
deep canyons.</p>
<p>Utah Highway 211, as mentioned already, is a 38-mile-long
paved road leading to the Needles district from U.S. Highway
163 at a point 15 miles north of Monticello and 18 miles south of
La Sal Junction. The intersection is well marked by Church Rock
(<a href="#fig37">fig. 37</a>), a butte of the Entrada Sandstone. Highway 211
gradually climbs an eastward-dipping slope of the Navajo
Sandstone dotted with a few buttes and patches of the Entrada
Sandstone, such as Church Rock, and reaches the first of two
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
summits 3 miles west of Highway 163. The road crosses a broad
gentle valley in the Navajo Sandstone, reaches the second summit
about 10 miles from the highway, then descends steeply
through the Navajo Sandstone and part of the Kayenta Formation
to Indian Creek, 1&frac12; miles below, and follows this creek
nearly to The Needles. Half a mile down the canyon takes us to
the top of the cliff-forming Wingate Sandstone, and another half
mile brings us to Indian Creek State Park and its striking
Newspaper Rock (<a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>). Another 1&frac34; miles takes us to the base
of the Wingate and top of the underlying Chinle Formation,
which forms the red slope beneath the cliffs.</p>
<p>Historic Dugout Ranch (<a href="#Page_14">p. 14</a>) is 19 miles west of the
highway, and from here a dry-weather road leads southward up
north Cottonwood Creek 37 miles to Beef Basin and connects
with roads to Elk Ridge and the Bears Ears, both just west of
the Abajo Mountains. Just west of the ranch we get a good view
ahead of two historic landmarks&mdash;North and South Six-Shooter
Peaks (<a href="#fig38">fig. 38</a>), so named because of their resemblance to a pair
of revolvers pointing skyward. The guns are sculptured from
slivers of Wingate Sandstone resting upon conical mounds of the
Chinle. These can be seen from a wide area; both appear in
figures <a href="#fig38">38</a> and <a href="#fig40">40</a>, and the north one is seen in <a href="#fig77">figure 77</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>A mile west of Dugout Ranch we descend to the top of the
Moss Back Member of the Chinle, a ledge of gray-green
sandstone forming the base of this generally red formation, and
reach the base of the member at the top of the Moenkopi Formation
in the next mile and a half. The Moss Back is uranium bearing
in nearby areas.</p>
<p>At 3.8 miles west of Dugout Ranch a poorly marked road on the
left crosses Indian Creek, then forks; the left-hand fork follows
the bed of Lavender Canyon, and the right-hand fork goes into
Davis Canyon. Headwaters of both these canyons are new additions
to the park.</p>
<p>The red Organ Rock Tongue of the Cutler Formation is seen
about 3 miles beyond the turnoff, or about 6 miles west of
Dugout Ranch. Another 1&frac12; miles takes us down in the rock
column (<a href="#fig9">fig. 9</a>) to the top of the Cedar Mesa Sandstone. The
White Rim Sandstone, which forms such a prominent bench
around the southern part of Island in the Sky (figs. <a href="#fig20">20</a>-<a href="#fig23">23</a>) and
west of the Green River, is missing from the Needles district, its
place in the rock column being taken by red shales and
sandstones of the Cutler Formation. South of Indian Creek other
underlying red beds of the Cutler are gradually replaced in turn
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
by the thick Cedar Mesa Sandstone. Erosion has reduced the
general level of the Needles district to or into the Cedar Mesa
Sandstone, but many streams have cut into the underlying Rico
Formation, and the Colorado River has cut also into, and in
places through, the limestones of the unnamed upper member of
the Hermosa Formation. Our first view of The Needles is
another 4 miles, and 1 more mile takes us to the park boundary,
nearly 32 miles from the U.S. Highway 163. We pass a road on
the right leading to Canyonlands Resort, and on the left is a new
line camp which replaces the restored one at Cave Spring (<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>).</p>
<p>The unusual features of the Needles district are due in some
part to the character and thickness of the underlying rocks but
in large part to erosion along joints and faults. Joints are fractures
along which no displacement has taken place, and faults
are fractures along which there has been displacement of the
two sides relative to one another (<a href="#fig76">fig. 76</a>). The Cedar Mesa
Sandstone comprises 500 to 600 feet or more of hard well-cemented
buff, white, and pink beds of massive sandstone. On
the basis of the type and amount of deformation and erosion of the
Cedar Mesa Sandstone and underlying rocks, the Needles district
can be divided into three differing areas: (1) an eastern area
where the rocks are relatively undeformed but are carved into
an intricate series of canyons, including Salt Canyon and the upper
reaches of Davis and Lavender Canyons&mdash;the section of the
district that contains most of the arches and Indian ruins; (2)
The Needles proper, where tensional forces have cracked the
brittle Cedar Mesa Sandstone into a crazy-quilt pattern of
square to rectangular blocks separated by joints widened by erosion,
creating a myriad of spires and pinnacles; and (3) The
Grabens, where the previously jointed rocks were later subjected
to additional tensional forces that produced a series of
nearly parallel faults that trend northeastward and separate
downdropped blocks of rock, called grabens, from intervening
stationary or upthrown blocks of rock, called horsts.</p>
<p>Let us examine each of these areas in the order named. For
traveling to most features a four-wheel-drive vehicle is strongly
recommended. Some visitors negotiate the jeep trails with dune
buggies or motorcycles, but four-wheel-drive vehicles are considered
safer and generally more reliable. A few trails can be
traveled only on foot.</p>
<p>Squaw Flat, in the western part of the relatively undeformed
area, is a nearly flat area of lower Cedar Mesa Sandstone
covered here and there by a thin layer of sparsely vegetated soil
and surrounded by generally low hilly erosional forms in the upper
part of the sandstone. Short canyons and alcoves in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
sandstone hills along the west side afford excellent semi-private
campsites, each of which has its own paved access road, picnic
table, and trash can (<a href="#fig39">fig. 39</a>). Moreover, ground water at shallow
depth in the underlying sandstone has encouraged the growth of
exceptionally large pi&ntilde;on and juniper trees that provide
welcome shade.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="c26">SALT, DAVIS, AND LAVENDER CANYONS</h3>
<p>A glance at the southeast corner of the map (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>) shows that
most of the arches and prehistoric ruins in the park are in Salt
Canyon and its main tributary, Horse Canyon. A few are in adjacent
Davis and Lavender Canyons, whose headwaters were
recently annexed to the park. These canyons are accessible only
by negotiating the streambeds on four-wheel-drive vehicles,
horseback, or foot. Salt or Horse Canyons are best conquered by
four-wheel-drive vehicles plus short hikes in the northern part
and long hikes in the southern part.</p>
<p>An aerial view (<a href="#fig40">fig. 40</a>) eastward across Salt Canyon shows
that erosion has produced an intricate series of meandering
canyons separated by rather narrow walls of the Cedar Mesa
Sandstone, resembling somewhat The Maze, west of the Green
River.</p>

</div>
<p>The massive sandstone beds of the Cedar Mesa are composed
of sand grains cemented together by calcium carbonate (CaCO&#8323;),
which also forms the mineral called calcite and the rock known
as limestone. Limestone and calcite are soluble in acid, even
weak acid such as carbonic acid (H&middot;HCO&#8323;), formed by solution of
carbon dioxide (CO&#8322;) in water. Ground water, found everywhere
in rock openings at differing depths beneath the surface, contains
considerable dissolved carbon dioxide derived from decaying
organic matter in soil, from the atmosphere, and from other
sources. Even rain water and snow contain small amounts absorbed
from the atmosphere&mdash;enough to dissolve small amounts
of limestone or of calcite cement in sandstone. The calcite cement
in the Cedar Mesa and many other sandstones is unevenly
distributed, so the cement is removed first from places that contain
the least amounts, and once the cement is dissolved, the
loose sand grains are carried away by gravity, wind, or water.
Thus, relatively thin walls of sandstone containing irregularly
distributed patches of soluble cement are prime targets for the
formation of potholes (<a href="#fig46">fig. 46</a>), alcoves, and caves. Once a
breakthrough occurs, weakened chunks from the ceiling tend to
fall off, and arches of various shapes are produced, because an
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
arch is naturally the strongest form that can support the overlying
rock load. Man, from the ancient Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians
to modern day, has long made use of arches in building
bridges, aqueducts, temples, cathedrals, and other enduring
edifices. All the spectacular arches we are about to see were
carved from the Cedar Mesa Sandstone.</p>
<p>Let us begin our tour of Salt and Horse Canyons by driving a
four-wheel-drive vehicle eastward from the fine campground at
Squaw Flat. After about a mile we pass the Wooden Shoe (<a href="#fig41">fig. 41</a>)
capping a ridge south of the highway; it contains one of the
smallest arches we will encounter. Three quarters of a mile east
of the temporary ranger station we come to Cave Spring, an old
restored cowboy line camp pictured in <a href="#fig6">figure 6</a>. This and an adjacent
cave containing a spring are part of the interesting well-marked
Environmental Trail, well worth the half hour or so it
requires.</p>

</div>
<p>The jeep trail up Salt Canyon lies mostly in the sandy bed of
Salt Creek but includes a few shortcuts across goosenecks and
some rough rocky stretches around rapids or waterfalls. It is
best traveled when the canyon bottom is moist but not soaked.
When the sand is soft and dry, a shift into four-wheel drive is
generally necessary. Signs warn of quicksand, which occurs
when the sand is fully saturated; hence, summer thundershowers
sometimes require delaying or postponing the trip.
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
When in doubt, consult a park ranger for expected weather and
trail conditions. Thundershowers sometimes occur so suddenly
and violently as to cause serious floods, and the &ldquo;road&rdquo; is closed
when heavy rain is expected. However, if an unexpected storm
occurs while you are up in the canyon, try to reach high ground
and wait until the flood subsides. If you do not have time to get
your vehicle out of the flood&rsquo;s path, at least get yourself and
passengers to a safe spot.</p>

<p class="pcap">PAUL BUNYANS POTTY, on east wall of Horse Canyon. (Fig. 42)</p>
</div>
<p>Two and a half miles south of Cave Spring we reach the confluence
with Horse Canyon, marked by a sign at the Y giving
distances to points of interest up each canyon. Let us try Horse
Canyon first. After about a mile we pass Paul Bunyans Potty on
the left&mdash;one of the most aptly titled features of the park (<a href="#fig42">fig. 42</a>).
Two miles south of the Y is Keyhole Ruin, nestled in a cleft
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
high on the cliff to our left&mdash;a granary built by the Anasazi.
Here we face another Y. The left fork leads half a mile east to
Tower Ruin (<a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>), one of the largest and best preserved
Anasazi granaries in the park. The right fork takes us on up
Horse Canyon, and in about 2 miles we pass Gothic Arch on the
right. In 2 more miles, 4 miles from Salt Canyon, a short hike up
the tributary to the right leads to Castle Arch and Thirteen
Faces. Assuming we have taken photographs of the important
features along the way, it probably is about time to return to
camp at Squaw Flat, unless we choose to spend the night at
Peek-a-boo Spring and primitive campground in Salt Canyon,
about 1.2 miles above the confluence with Horse Canyon.</p>
<p>Another drive takes us up Salt Canyon 8&frac12; miles past the confluence
with Horse Canyon to another confluence and Y, which
has a primitive campsite without water. One mile up the left, or
southeast, tributary is a parking area where we begin the &frac12;-mile
walk to Angel Arch, considered by many people to be the
most beautiful and spectacular arch in the park if not in the entire
canyon country. Angel Arch was drawn for the front cover
by John R. Stacy and is pictured in <a href="#fig43">figure 43</a>.</p>

<p>From the last Y we can proceed only about 2&frac12; miles farther
up main Salt Canyon by vehicle, and the remaining features
shown on the map (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>) can be reached only on foot. The All
American Man, a unique pictograph referred to earlier (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>), is
about 3&frac12; miles up the canyon. Those hardy souls who wish to
hike many additional miles to the head of Salt Canyon will be
rewarded with views of four additional arches and several ruins.
Two of these arches are shown in figures <a href="#fig44">44</a> and <a href="#fig45">45</a>.</p>
<p>The more adventuresome may wish to explore upper Lavender
and Davis Canyons by driving up the sand washes in a four-wheel-drive
vehicle, but inquiry should be made from a park
ranger regarding access to the canyon mouths and condition of
the washes. Hand Holt Arch (<a href="#fig46">fig. 46</a>) and Cleft Arch (<a href="#fig47">fig. 47</a>) are
two of the rewarding sights in Lavender Canyon, and <a href="#fig48">figure 48</a>

shows The Needles in the foreground and The Grabens in the

hikes.</p>

<p>Ordinary passenger cars now can go 2&frac34; miles west of Squaw
Flat to Soda Spring, at the east base of Elephant Hill, but
beyond Soda Spring four-wheel-drive vehicles should be used.
Some people conquer the hill in dune buggies or on motorcycles,
but this is considered quite dangerous. Both sides of this short
(1&frac14; miles) but formidable hill have switchback curves too sharp
to negotiate in the regular manner, so special driving techniques
must be followed. On the east side, you must drive out on a flat
rock, jockey back and forth until turned completely around, then
proceed up the hill. On the west side, you descend a 40-percent
grade to a shelf, <i>back</i> down a narrow stretch of about 30-percent
grade and back sharply to the left onto a flat rock, then go
forward again. On the return trip the whole procedure is carried
out in reverse order.</p>
<p>West of Elephant Hill, the road reaches a Y, at which you
must turn left on a one-way road; the right-hand road is for later
one-way return to the Y. Why the left-hand fork is one way soon
becomes apparent, for the road leads into a narrow shallow
graben, called Devils Pocket (<a href="#fig51">fig. 51</a>), between rock walls, and is
barely wide enough for one car. After about 2 miles the graben
widens out into a beautiful spot called the Devils Kitchen, which
contains several picnic tables tucked into shady recesses in the
sandstone walls. This is the starting point for two trails leading
southward by different routes to Chesler Park, from which
other trails lead to Druid Arch or back to Squaw Flat.</p>
<p>From the Devils Kitchen, the road turns abruptly westward
for about half a mile to another Y in about the middle of Devils
Lane, one of the larger grabens and one of two whose entire
length is traversed by roads, as shown on the map (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>). Only
the left fork is a two-way road, so let us take the left fork 2&frac34;
miles southwestward to the next road junction. About halfway
down Devils Lane, a fault crossing the graben has created a
narrow steep ridge appropriately called SOB Hill, because the
road over it creates a challenge that some vehicles fail to meet on
the first attempt!</p>
<p>The next road intersection is now shown on the map (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>) as
a sharp turn leading southwest to Ruin Park and Beef Basin.
The abandoned left fork (not shown) leads east into Chesler
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
Park. This park, shown in <a href="#fig50">figure 50</a> and near the bottom of
<a href="#fig51">figure 51</a>, is a beautiful natural meadow of several hundred
acres fenced by a natural wall of needles and containing a central
island of needles. Because of vehicular damage to meadow
vegetation, the National Park Service found it necessary to close
the road. To reach Chesler Park now, vehicles must go right a
short distance to the Chesler Canyon turnoff, then left about
half a mile to a parking area. From here, a &frac12;-mile hike east
through the narrow Joint Trail gets us to the south side of
Chesler Park, where we join the abandoned road to reach the
northeast corner of the park and the trails into The Needles
proper (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>).</p>
<p>This change adds 1&frac34; miles (one way) to the hike to Druid
Arch, making the round trip about 11&frac12; miles. At the old
trailhead, near the northeast corner of Chesler Park, is a sign
proclaiming the need for rubber-soled shoes and water, and I
strongly support these admonitions, for much of the hike is on
bare smooth sandstone and includes steep slopes and <i>generally</i>
dry waterfalls. The hike should not be attempted by anyone not
in good physical condition, and it should not be undertaken
alone; two or more people should travel together.</p>
<p>As shown in <a href="#fig52">figure 52</a>, the trail to Druid Arch from Chesler
Park starts out on bare Cedar Mesa Sandstone marked by a
succession of rock cairns, two of which are visible and without
which the trail would soon be lost. The trail drops rapidly down
into Elephant Canyon, which is then followed southward 2 miles
to the arch. This canyon has cut through the Cedar Mesa into the
underlying Rico Formation, and much of the canyon is quite
narrow and steep sided, as shown in <a href="#fig53">figure 53</a>. Although much of
the Rico consists of red beds laid down above sea level by ancient
streams, the trail crosses several thin beds of dark-gray hard
limestone containing fossil marine seashells and ancient sea
anemones whose original calcium carbonate parts have been
locally replaced by jasper (red iron-bearing silica). When at last
the weary hiker makes the steep climb out of the canyon and
rounds the final bare-rock curve, the sudden and striking view of
Druid Arch (<a href="#fig54">fig. 54</a>) seems worth every bit of the effort&mdash;at least
it was to me and my hiking companion.</p>
<p>After my friend and I hiked to Druid Arch and after the
length of this route was increased to a round-trip distance of
11&frac12; miles, a new route was constructed having a round-trip
length of only 8&frac12; miles. This new trail starts at the end of the
passenger-car road at the east edge of Elephant Hill, goes 1&frac14;
miles southwest to join an older trail in Elephant Canyon, then
follows this canyon 3 miles south to the arch.</p>

<p>After returning to our vehicle west of Chesler Park and
backtracking over SOB Hill to the intersection in the middle of
Devils Lane, let us proceed northward on a one-way road to and
beyond the Silver Stairs for a closer look at Devils Lane and
other grabens to the west and for a look at the confluence of the
Green and Colorado Rivers. But first let us pause and reflect
upon the possible origin of The Grabens.</p>
<p>Geologists have different opinions as to just how grabens and
complex systems of joints have formed, but all seem to agree
that tensional forces were involved. Some think that solution of
salt and gypsum from the Paradox Member of the Hermosa Formation
by ground-water movement allowed the brittle Cedar
Mesa Sandstone and other overlying rocks to sag, producing tension
cracks and faults. Others believe that removal of the salt
and gypsum occurred by plastic flowage toward the Meander anticline
(see <a href="#Page_108">p. 108</a> and <a href="#fig61">fig. 61</a>), whose axis follows the Colorado
River southwest from The Loop, past the confluence, and to and
beyond Spanish Bottom. Some suppose that compaction due to
the weight of the abnormally thick pile of sedimentary rock underlying
the area may have caused the sagging, cracking, and
faulting. The rock deformation may have resulted from a combination
of these and possibly other things, of course, but
whatever the cause, the resulting features are very striking.
There was room to show only two of the named grabens within
the park on the map (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>), but all are shown in <a href="#fig51">figure 51</a>, and
several appear in <a href="#fig59">figure 59</a>. A diagramatic cross section of a
typical graben is shown in <a href="#fig55">figure 55</a>. The tension faults shown in
figures <a href="#fig55">55</a> and <a href="#fig56">56</a> are called normal faults, in contrast to faults
formed by horizontal compression, which are called reverse
faults (figs. <a href="#fig75">75</a>, <a href="#fig76">76</a>).</p>
<p>The Grabens range in width from about 7 or 8 feet at the north
end of Devils Pocket to nearly 2,000 feet at the south end of Red
Lake Canyon, but the average width is about 500 feet. The floors
of The Grabens are covered by soil and grass, but the displacement
along the faults is believed to approximate the height of
the walls&mdash;nearly 300 feet. That The Grabens are of fairly recent
origin is attested by the fact that most of the walls are vertical
fault faces showing little sign of erosion (<a href="#fig57">fig. 57</a>); that no
through drainage has yet been established in Cyclone Canyon,
which is a series of basins with low divides between; and that
several pre-existing streams were interrupted or diverted by the
faulting.</p>

</div>
<p>Now let us continue our journey northward along Devils Lane.
Just before reaching the Silver Stairs we may wish to pause long
enough to take in the distant view to the northwest toward Junction
Butte and Grand View Point. (See <a href="#pic1">frontispiece</a>.) After
descending the steep Silver Stairs in a narrow cleft between rock
walls, we reach another intersection: a two-way road continuing
northwest goes to our destination, and a one-way road turning
right returns to Elephant Hill via part of Elephant Canyon (<a href="#fig58">fig. 58</a>).</p>
<p>About 2 miles to the northwest we cross the north end of
Cyclone Canyon, the largest graben. It contains a road 3&frac12; miles
long and is well worth seeing. About one-half mile from the
south end, an old trail follows Red Lake and Lower Red Lake
Canyons to the Colorado River across from Spanish Bottom
(figs. <a href="#fig1">1</a>, <a href="#fig61">61</a>).</p>
<p>From near the north end of Cyclone Canyon (figs. <a href="#fig1">1</a>, <a href="#fig59">59</a>), we
drive west three-fourths mile to a parking area and hike one-half
mile to an overlook for a spectacular view of the confluence of
the Green and Colorado Rivers (figs. <a href="#fig59">59</a>, <a href="#fig60">60</a>) and of the northern
part of Cataract Canyon (<a href="#fig61">fig. 61</a>). These and other canyons are
discussed in the next chapter.</p>

<p>We have discussed two of the three major topographic
divisions of the park&mdash;the high mesas and the benchlands&mdash;and
there remains to consider the third division&mdash;the canyons of the
mighty Green and Colorado Rivers and some of their tributaries.
After we discuss a few features common to both rivers, we will
take up the details of each river.</p>
<p>A glance at the map (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>) shows that above the confluence
both rivers are very crooked and contain many loops, or
meanders, the most striking of which are Bowknot Bend of the
Green River (<a href="#fig62">fig. 62</a>), several miles north of the park, and The
Loop of the Colorado River (<a href="#fig74">fig. 74</a>). In contrast, the main stem
of the Colorado River below the confluence is considerably
straighter. Not apparent on the map are the facts that the
crooked rivers above the confluence have very gentle grades and
are free from rapids or falls, whereas a few miles south of the
confluence the main stem plunges into Cataract Canyon&mdash;the
steepest and wildest reach of the river, containing 64 rapids.
These differences are partly explicable on the basis of the
geologic structure and character of the rocks through which the
rivers have cut. Above the confluence, the soft strata dip gently
northward, so in flowing generally southward the two rivers are
cutting &ldquo;against the grain,&rdquo; which tends to impede their flow
and thus reduce their grades. Below the confluence, the hard
limestones of the Hermosa Formation lie relatively flat for
several miles and then begin to dip gently southward, thus
allowing the river to cut &ldquo;with the grain&rdquo; and therefore drop
more rapidly.</p>
<p>The quiet, smooth waters above the confluence permit
power boating between the towns of Green River, Utah, and
Moab during part of the year, whereas the rapids below Spanish
Bottom, 3&frac12; miles below the confluence, restrict river travel to
float trips using sturdy boats or rafts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>Above the confluence, a so-called Friendship Cruise is run
each year during the Memorial Day weekend. Participants tow
their own power boats on trailers to the town of Green River,
and after the boats are launched, facilities are available at
nominal cost for transporting cars and boat trailers to Moab to
await the arrival of the boats. Although some high-powered
speedboats are reported to have made the run down the Green
River to the confluence then up the Colorado River to Moab in a
few hours, the trip for most boats requires 2 to 7 days.</p>
<p>Trips by power boats, including jet boats, can be arranged
from either Green River or Moab. Some passengers from Moab
return by jeep from Lathrop Canyon via the White Rim Trail,
and some from Green River return on land via the Horsethief
Trail. Many prefer the quieter float trip down to the confluence,
with return to either town by a prescheduled power boat, and
some more adventurous souls float through the rapids of
Cataract Canyon all the way to Lake Powell.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1972, a 93-foot 150-passenger stern-wheeler
(<a href="#fig69">fig. 69</a>) began passenger service on the Colorado River from just
above Potash to the foot of Dead Horse Point and return
(Lansford, 1972).</p>
<h3 id="c29">Entrenched and cutoff meanders</h3>
<p>Meanders such as those above the confluence generally are
formed by streams flowing in soft alluvium consisting of clay,
silt, and sand, such as along the Mississippi River below Cairo,
Ill. But there is no soft alluvium along the Colorado and Green
Rivers, so how did these meanders form? They probably attained
their serpentine shape while cutting in softer, younger
material, which long ago was removed by erosion, and then continued
to cut their crooked channels down, until they created the
deep rock-walled canyons in which they now flow as &ldquo;entrenched&rdquo;
meanders.</p>
<p>Meandering streams tend to shorten their lengths from time
to time by cutting through narrow walls between adjacent loops,
leaving abandoned horseshoe-shaped channels or lakes. In most
of the United States these are known as oxbows or cutoff
meanders, but in the desert Southwest they are commonly called
by the Spanish term &ldquo;rincon.&rdquo; Cutoffs are common along soft
alluvial channels such as the lower Mississippi River valley but
are rare along channels whose meanders are entrenched into
hard rock. Thus, there have been many natural (and several
manmade) cutoffs along the lower Mississippi during historic
times, but the most recent ones along the Green and upper
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
Colorado Rivers probably occurred a million or so years ago,
during the Pleistocene Epoch (figs. <a href="#fig65">65</a>, <a href="#fig80">80</a>).</p>
<p>Mark Twain served several years as an expert riverboat pilot
on the Mississippi River during which several cutoffs took place.
Chapter 27 of his &ldquo;Life on the Mississippi&rdquo; contains sage
references to both natural and artificial cutoffs and concludes
with a few good-natured jibes at geologists in particular and
scientists in general:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore the Mississippi between Cairo and New Orleans was twelve hundred
and fifteen miles long one hundred and seventy six years ago. It was eleven hundred
and eighty after the cutoff of 1722. It was one thousand and forty after the
American Bend cut-off. It has lost sixty-seven miles since. Consequently, its
length is only nine hundred and seventy-three miles at present.</p>
<p>Now, if I wanted to be one of those ponderous scientific people, and &ldquo;let on&rdquo; to
prove what had occurred in the remote past by what had occurred in a given time
in the recent past, or what will occur in the far future by what has occurred in
late years, what an opportunity is here! Geology never had such a chance, nor
such exact data to argue from! Nor &ldquo;development of species,&rdquo; either! Glacial
epochs are great things, but they are vague&mdash;vague. Please observe:</p>
<p>In the space of one hundred and seventy-six years the Lower Mississippi has
shortened itself two hundred and forty two miles. That is an average of a trifle
over one mile and a third per year. Therefore, any calm person, who is not blind
or idiotic, can see that in the Old O&ouml;litic Silurian Period, just a million years ago
next November, the Lower Mississippi River was upward of one million three
hundred thousand miles long, and stuck out over the Gulf of Mexico like a fishing
rod. And by the same token any person can see that seven hundred and forty-two
years from now the Lower Mississippi will be only a mile and three-quarters
long, and Cairo and New Orleans will have joined their streets together, and be
plodding comfortably along under a single mayor and a mutual board of aldermen.
There is something fascinating about science. One gets such wholesale
returns of conjecture out of such a trifling investment of fact.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="c30">Green River</h3>
<p>Much more has been written about the Green River and the
main stem of the Colorado than about the Colorado above the
confluence (the former Grand River), because all but one of the
early float trips began on the Green. The first reports concerning
Powell&rsquo;s memorable voyages of 1869 and 1871 were his articles
published in Scribners Monthly during 1874 and 1875
followed by his formal 1875 report &ldquo;Exploration of the Colorado
River of the West and Its Tributaries.&rdquo; As pointed out by Porter
(1969, p. 21), however, Powell&rsquo;s narrative</p>
<blockquote>
<p>is written <i>as if</i> everything chronicled therein occurred during the first trip.
Events which actually occurred in 1871 and 1872 are reported as happening in
1869. There is no mention of the personnel of the 1871-72 party, nor is there an
indication that there even <i>was</i> a second trip. The engravings illustrating the
report were made from photographs taken by Beaman and Hillers between 1871
and 1874, but this fact is not noted.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>For these reasons, Porter&rsquo;s account contains Powell&rsquo;s diary of
the first (1869) trip and many of the missing photographs, plus
his own beautiful color prints. Much more complete and accurate
accounts of the 1871 voyage than those of Powell, including
many of the photographs taken by Beaman and Hillers,
were given by Dellenbaugh (1902, 1962), who was a member of
Powell&rsquo;s 1871 expedition.</p>
<p>Numerous river trips were undertaken in the years following
Powell&rsquo;s pioneering expeditions. The ill-fated Brown-Stanton
voyage of 1889-90 included starts on both the Grand and the
Green Rivers. (See section on &ldquo;<a href="#c31">Colorado River</a>.&rdquo;) More successful
were Nathan Galloway and William Richmond, trappers who
left Henrys Fork, Wyo., late in 1896 and reached Needles, Calif.,
on February 10, 1897 (Kolb, 1927, p. 338). Trappers Charles S.
Russell, E. R. Monette, and Bert Loper left Green River, Utah, in
three steel boats on September 20, 1907; Russell and Monette
reached Needles in one boat in February 1908, but Loper was
drowned. Dellenbaugh&rsquo;s 1902 book was carried by the Kolb
brothers as a guide for their 1911 trip down the river (Kolb,
1927). In addition to making superb still photographs, the Kolb
brothers took the first moving pictures in the canyons, and these
are still being shown in the Kolb Studio on the South Rim of the
Grand Canyon. Julius F. Stone and party traversed the canyons
in 1909, and his account (1932) also contains excellent
photographs. E. C. La Rue, of the U.S. Geological Survey, and
assistants made two trips down the Green and Colorado Rivers
in 1914 and 1915 and additional trips from 1921 through 1924.
Their comprehensive hydrographic findings and studies, plus excellent
photographs, are given in two reports (La Rue, 1916,
1925). The 1916 report also contains (p. 16-22) a good condensed
account of earlier explorations and voyages from 1531 through
1911, taken in part from Dellenbaugh (1902).</p>
<p>As noted earlier, a modern river runners&rsquo; guide by Mutschler
(1969), which logs the Green and Colorado Rivers from Green
River, Utah, to Lake Powell, is now available. River mileages in
this log were taken from detailed topographic maps of both
rivers prepared under the direction of Herron (1917). We will
visit only a few notable features of the canyons; the mile-by-mile
details for the Green River can be obtained from Mutschler
(1969), and those for the Colorado River, from Baars and
Molenaar (1971, p. 61-99). Several other references are given
below, and additional ones are given by Rabbitt (1969, p. 20-21).</p>

from same camera station on August 19, 1968, by Hal G. Stephens, U.S. Geological
Survey, on expedition led by E. M. Shoemaker to recover camera stations of the 1871
voyage and rephotograph the scenes to record changes during the nearly 100 year
interval. Note that almost no changes occurred in the bedrock, or even in the loose rocks,
but that considerable change occurred in the vegetation along the river. Although salt
cedar (tamarisk) had been introduced into this country from the Mediterranean area long
before 1871, it had not yet spread to this area, but the bare islands shown in the earlier
photograph are covered by salt cedar in the 1968 photograph. (Fig. 62)</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>All travelers down the Green River embarking from Green
River, Utah, or above, were impressed with Bowknot Bend (<a href="#fig62">fig. 62</a>),
so named by Powell and his men (1875, p. 54) near the beginning
of Labyrinth Canyon, which they also named for its deeply
entrenched meanders. The upper photograph in <a href="#fig62">figure 62</a> was
taken by Beaman on September 10, 1871, looking eastward from
the west end of the narrow saddle separating the upper and
lower reaches of the river; the <a href="#fig62">lower photograph</a> was taken from
the same point on August 19, 1968, by Hal G. Stephens nearly 97
years later. Although there are changes in the vegetation, as
described in the caption, there are virtually no visible changes in
the bedrock. Nevertheless, the distant future will likely see a
breakthrough, whereby Green River will shorten itself by about
7 miles (Herron, 1917, pl. 15C). It is interesting to note that the
vertical cliffs of Wingate Sandstone in and west of Bowknot
Bend are only a few hundred feet above the river, whereas,
because of the gentle northward dip of the beds and the gentle
southward grade of the rivers, the Wingate cliffs are more than
2,000 feet above the two rivers at Grand View Point and Junction
Butte, at the southern tip of Island in the Sky.</p>
<p>At the mouth of Horseshoe Canyon, about 3 miles below
Bowknot Bend, we pass a large rincon where the Green River
shortened its course by about 3 miles. Some idea of the rincon&rsquo;s
antiquity is gained from the facts that the river is now some 350
feet lower than at cutoff time, whereas Bowknot Bend (<a href="#fig62">fig. 62</a>)
has shown no visible deepening in 97 years. This rincon was not
noted by Powell or other early voyagers, seemingly because they
did not happen to climb the banks at this point, but it is quite
noticeable on modern topographic maps and on aerial
photographs. This rincon and Jackson Hole along the Colorado
River may be as old as late Tertiary (<a href="#fig80">fig. 80</a>).</p>
<p>At a point reported to be 350 yards above the mouth of Hell
Roaring Canyon, which enters from the east about 3&frac12; miles
below the rincon, an early day trapper named Julien left his
mark. Stone (1932, p. 69, pl. 39A) seems to have been the first
river runner to find (from a description given him by a Mr.
Wheeler at Green River), record, and photograph the inscription
shown in <a href="#fig63">figure 63</a>. Mutschler (1969, p. 31) indicated that this inscription
is carved on a massive Moenkopi sandstone bed about
40 feet above the canyon floor. A similar inscription by Julien
was found in Cataract Canyon, 31 miles below the confluence,
but it is now covered by Lake Powell (Mutschler, 1969, p. 65).</p>
<p>Some boaters are met by car and taken out to Moab or Green
River via the Horsethief Trail (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>), just north of the park. The
road along the river here continues south for 6&frac12; miles to the
mouths of Taylor and Upheaval Canyons, where it becomes the
White Rim Trail.</p>

</div>
<p>Coming down the Green River, we enter Canyonlands
National Park where the Grand-San Juan county line meets the
Emery-Wayne county line (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>), about 2&frac14; miles north of
Taylor and Upheaval Canyons. The National Park Service had
three successful test wells put down in Taylor Canyon, and
water under artesian pressure was found in the White Rim
Sandstone at depths of 373 to 482 feet. When funds become
available, they hope to complete one or more of these wells and
pump the water up to Island in the Sky, where two dry holes
were drilled earlier.</p>
<p>About 5&frac12; miles below Upheaval Canyon is an interesting ruin
on a hill in the middle of a large nearly closed loop of the river
enclosing Fort Bottom. This was noted by Dellenbaugh (1902)
during Powell&rsquo;s 1871 trip and was described in more detail by
Mutschler (1969, p. 33-34):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ruin consists of two, two-story, interconnected, crudely circular towers, and
a third separate, completely collapsed tower, built on the summit of the bluff
with a commanding view downriver and of Fort Bottom. Other collapsed structures
are present on the summit, and a slab-lined cist is present beneath the
Moss Back ledge west of the towers. The ruin was built of dry laid masonry and
most of the mud plaster on the inside has been washed away, leaving the structure
in danger of imminent collapse. Please do not climb the walls!</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Fort Bottom also contains a cabin believed to have been used by
Butch Cassidy and the Wild Bunch (Baker, 1971, p. 198).</p>
<p>At about the mouth of Millard Canyon, we leave Labyrinth
Canyon and enter Stillwater Canyon, aptly named by members
of the 1869 Powell voyage (Dellenbaugh, 1902, p. 276). The beginning
of Stillwater Canyon is marked by vertical walls of the
White Rim Sandstone. From here Powell&rsquo;s men observed a butte
to the southwest thought to resemble a fallen cross and named it
&ldquo;Butte of the Cross.&rdquo; Farther downstream they realized they
had been looking at two buttes, a small one in front of a larger
one, so the feature was renamed &ldquo;Buttes of the Cross.&rdquo; An aerial
view of Buttes of the Cross is shown in <a href="#fig64">figure 64</a>.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>About 2 miles below the mouth of Millard Canyon, at Anderson
Bottom, we reach one of the most interesting features on the
river&mdash;the most recent rincon of a major river in the park, if not
in the entire canyon country. Although some rincons are more
recent, they are along minor tributaries such as Indian Creek
(<a href="#fig73">fig. 73</a>). The cutoff at Anderson Bottom probably took place
during the Pleistocene Epoch, whereas most of the others along
the main rivers probably occurred during the Tertiary Period
(<a href="#fig80">fig. 80</a>). An aerial view of the Anderson Bottom rincon is shown
in <a href="#fig65">figure 65</a>, and a sketch of the drainage change is shown in
<a href="#fig66">figure 66</a>. This feature was noted and correctly interpreted by
Powell and his men, who applied the name Bonita Bend to the
sharp new course the river took after the cutoff.</p>
<p>Continuing through Stillwater Canyon, we pass Turks Head
(figs. <a href="#fig23">23</a>, <a href="#fig24">24</a>) and head for the confluence of the Green River with
the Colorado River. <a href="#fig67">Figure 67</a> shows the canyon just west of the
confluence. The lowest and largest cliff above the river is the upper
member of the Hermosa Formation, overlain by the slopes
and thin ledges of the Rico Formation. The massive sandstone at
the top of the canyon wall is the Cedar Mesa. Junction Butte and
Grand View Point are on the right skyline.</p>
<p>We have already viewed the confluence and Cataract Canyon
from the land and from the air (figs. <a href="#fig59">59</a>-<a href="#fig61">61</a>); soon we will see

<h3 id="c31">Colorado River</h3>
<p>As indicated earlier, all but one of the early river voyages
began on the Green River. The Grand (Colorado) River above the
confluence was neglected for some 18 years after Powell&rsquo;s second
voyage, until, in 1889, Frank M. Brown organized a company for
construction of the proposed Denver, Colorado Canyon, and
Pacific Railway. This railroad was to carry coal from mines in
Colorado over a &ldquo;water-level&rdquo; line through the canyons of the
Colorado River to the Gulf of California some 1,200 miles away;
from there the coal would presumably be shipped to ports as far
north as San Francisco (Dellenbaugh, 1902, p. 343-369). On
March 26, 1889, Brown, president, F. C. Kendrick, chief
engineer, and T. P. Rigney, assistant engineer, drove the first
stake for a survey of the new line at Grand Junction, Colo., then
Brown left for the East to obtain financing, and the other two
plus some hired hands took off down the Grand River. After
reaching the confluence they towed the boat up the Green River,
thus becoming the first to make this trip upstream. They nearly
ran out of food, but thanks to the hospitality of some cattlemen,
they replenished their stock and after about 9 days reached the
railroad at Green River, Utah. Brown, who had returned from
the East, his newly appointed chief engineer, Robert Brewster
Stanton, and 14 others in six ill-designed boats of cedar, rather
than oak, left Green River on May 25, 1889. Against the advice of
Major Powell and A. H. Thompson, Powell&rsquo;s topographer on the
1871 trip, they carried no life preservers. After many mishaps,
Brown and two others were drowned near the head of Marble
Canyon, and the ill-fated expedition was temporarily halted.
However, the indefatigable Stanton contracted for new boats
built of oak and, with a reorganized party of 12, left the mouth of
the Fremont (Dirty Devil) River on November 25. After many
further mishaps, the party finally reached the Gulf of California
on April 26, 1890. Needless to say the proposed railway was not
built.</p>
<p>Although the Colorado River enters Canyonlands National
Park about 33 river miles below Moab, most boaters or floaters
begin their voyage either at Moab or near Potash, and most
travelers of the White Rim Trail begin at Moab, so we will start
our trip at Moab. No logs or river runners&rsquo; guides are available
as yet for the reach from Moab to Potash, but below Potash
some details of the geology have been described by Baars in
Baars and Molenaar (1971, p. 59-87).</p>
<p>As noted at the beginning of this chapter, above the confluence
both the Green and Colorado Rivers are very crooked,
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
have very low grades, and are free from rapids. As with the
Green, the soft rocks along the Colorado have a generally low
northward dip that partly explains the river&rsquo;s gentle grade and
its southward flow through increasingly lower and older strata.
Unlike the Green, however, the gentle dips of the strata in the
canyons of the Colorado are interrupted by several gentle anticlinal
(<a href="#fig14">fig. 14</a>) and synclinal (<a href="#fig26">fig. 26</a>) folds and by at least one
fault. The most important of these geologic structures and other
features will be noted as we journey down the river.</p>
<p>The first 14 miles from Moab Valley to Potash can be made
either by river or by paved Utah Highway 279. This highway
leaves U.S. Highway 163 near the uranium ore-reduction plant
several miles northwest of Moab, leaves Moab Valley through
The Portal (<a href="#fig68">fig. 68</a>), and follows the west bank of the river. A
paved secondary road from Moab follows the east bank of the
river through The Portal and through Kings Bottom, where it
crosses the Kings Bottom syncline, to the mouth of Kane
Springs Canyon, then becomes a gravel road that ascends this
canyon southward to and beyond Hurrah Pass (<a href="#fig30">fig. 30</a>). High
above this road north of Kings Bottom are petroglyphs and a few
cliff dwellings in the vertical cliffs of Wingate Sandstone. A
ranch &ldquo;house&rdquo; at Kings Bottom has been excavated entirely into
the Wingate cliff. Convenient turnouts have been provided at
several places along Highway 279 for viewing petroglyphs or
other points of interest. Small viewing tubes welded to vertical
steel posts having signs help visitors locate and see the features
described.</p>

<p class="pcap">THE PORTAL, in south wall of Moab Valley, through which the Colorado River, Utah
Highway 279 (on right), and a paved secondary road (on left) leave the valley to enter
the canyons in and above Canyonlands National Park. Rounded remnants on top are
Navajo Sandstone; cliffs are Kayenta Formation and Wingate Sandstone; red slopes are
Chinle and Moenkopi Formations, and perhaps a little of the Cutler Formation at the
base. Light-colored patches at base of slope behind trees on left are contorted intrusions
of Paradox Member of Hermosa Formation. (Fig. 68).</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>The Kings Bottom syncline (<a href="#fig30">fig. 30</a>) southwest of Moab Valley
brings the Navajo Sandstone down to and slightly below water
level, whereas at The Portal (<a href="#fig68">fig. 68</a>) the Navajo caps the
southwest wall of Moab Valley. Several anticlines at or near the
river from Potash to and beyond the confluence (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>) bring up
strata as old as the Rico or the unnamed upper member of the
Hermosa. Between these extremes, much of the river&rsquo;s course
lies in strata of the Cutler Formation.</p>
<p>About 7 miles below The Portal, Highway 279 is joined on the
right by a branch line of the Denver and Rio Grand Western
Railroad completed in 1962 to haul potash 36 miles from the
mine at Potash north to the main line at Crescent Junction. The
railroad emerges from a tunnel at the head of Bootlegger Canyon.
Two natural arches near the mouth of the tunnel&mdash;Pinto
and Little Rainbow Bridge&mdash;can be reached by trail. About 3
miles farther down the Colorado is a temporary dock from which
jet boats and the <i>Canyon King</i>, a 93-foot 150-passenger
stern-wheeler, take off for points downriver during the spring
and early summer, when water depth permits. The <i>Canyon King</i>
(<a href="#fig69">fig. 69</a>), a small replica of a Mississippi River stern-wheeler,
carries passengers about 30 miles downriver to the foot of Dead
Horse Point and returns (Lansford, 1972).</p>
<p>About 12 miles below The Portal we reach Potash&mdash;the potash
&ldquo;mine&rdquo; (<a href="#fig70">fig. 70</a>) of Texas Gulf, Inc. (See <a href="#fig31">fig. 31</a> and its associated
text for description of operation.) Travelers down the jeep trail
below Potash pass the evaporation ponds (<a href="#fig71">fig. 71</a>) used to
separate the potash from common salt.</p>

<p>Across the river east from Potash is Jackson Hole, a large rincon.
Since abandonment, which shortened the river by about 3&frac12;
miles, the river has cut its channel nearly 200 feet deeper. It is
comparable in size to the large rincon along Green River below
Bowknot Bend (<a href="#Page_90">p. 90</a>) but probably is somewhat younger. Both
rincons may be as old as late Tertiary (<a href="#fig80">fig. 80</a>). Just below
Potash we cross the axis of the huge Cane Creek anticline (<a href="#fig31">fig. 31</a>)
and also leave Grand County to enter San Juan County. A
mile east of this point, high on the canyon wall, is the School
Section 13 uranium mine, which has yielded considerable ore
and is expected to resume production sometime during 1973. It
can be seen from the river or the trail, and some of the tailings
are visible on the left flank of the anticline in <a href="#fig13">figure 13</a>.</p>
<p>Voyagers who cross the axis of the Cane Creek anticline may
observe on the right-hand (west) bank a protruding oil-well casing,
some drill bits, and several shacks&mdash;all that remain of the
Frank Shafer No. 1 oil test started during the winter of 1924-25
and completed by the Midwest Exploration Co. (Baker, 1933, p.
81). As described by Maxine Newell (U.S. Natl. Park Service,
written commun., 1970),</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The well blew in in December 1925, caught fire, and spewed burning oil 300 feet
into the air. * * * The local Times-Independent newspaper called it &ldquo;Mother
Nature&rsquo;s Christmas Gift to Grand County.&rdquo; The gusher burned down the rig, a
barge of equipment, and it took three months to get it under control. Then it
didn&rsquo;t produce.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Various 1925 and 1926 issues of the Moab Times-Independent
reported that despite many efforts to plug the well, it continued
to flow from 1,000 to several thousand barrels of oil per day for 6
months or more, all of which floated down the river. The last
blowout occurred in 1937, after which the well was plugged with
an additional 180 tons of cement.</p>
<p>Mrs. Newell added,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The stories told of the early-day exploration are endless and delightful. Equipment
and supplies were barged down the Colorado River by the old Moab Garage
Company; in winter months materials were carried by team and sled over the
river ice. They would take a couple of rig timbers and pile a lot of lumber on
them (they could take 10,000 feet), then we&rsquo;d give them a start with a crowbar
and the mules would trot all the way downhill to the well. When they&rsquo;d get there
they had a little trouble stopping sometimes; they would turn into the bank, unload,
then put the double trees on one mule, ride the other, and head back for a
new load of rig lumber.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The evaporation ponds shown in figures <a href="#fig31">31</a> and <a href="#fig71">71</a> are in
Shafer Basin, a synclinal basin separating the Cane Creek anticline
and Shafer dome. We cross the axis of Shafer Basin about
2 miles below the county line.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Further downstream is Shafer dome, a closed anticlinal bulge
just beyond the W-shaped bend in the river as shown in <a href="#fig29">figure 29</a>.
Parts of the dome also show up in the lower right of <a href="#fig13">figure 13</a>
and the lower left of <a href="#fig15">figure 15</a>. From almost anywhere in the
Goose Neck, the sharp bend of the river shown in <a href="#fig15">figure 15</a>, we
get an excellent view of Dead Horse Point some 2,000 feet above.</p>
<p>Robert R. Norman (oral commun. Feb. 27, 1973) described to
me a small petrified forest&mdash;which he said resembles a log
jam&mdash;in the eastern part of the Shafer dome, at mileage 39
(Baars and Molenaar, 1971, p. 65), just north of this point about
half way between the river and the jeep trail below Dead Horse
Point. He estimated that there probably are 20 to 30 logs, some
of which are as large as 18 inches in diameter and more than 20
feet long, and also described a stump about 3 feet in diameter.
They occur in red beds at about the middle of the Rico Formation,
hence could be either Pennsylvanian or Permian in age
(figs. <a href="#fig9">9</a>, <a href="#fig80">80</a>). The original wood has been replaced by silica (SiO&#8322;)
and stained a dark reddish brown, as shown in <a href="#fig72">figure 72</a>.</p>
<p>Mr. Norman and his brother also discovered many teeth of a
primitive sharklike fish in the Rico Formation at the same
general locality as the petrified wood and also in the Rico on the
Cane Creek anticline. I submitted two of the teeth to Dr. David
H. Dunkle, curator of the Cleveland Museum of Natural
History, who reported them to be &ldquo;one tooth of the cochliodont
&lsquo;shark&rsquo; <i>Deltodus</i>, and one tooth of the petalodont &lsquo;shark&rsquo;
<i>Petalodus</i>&rdquo; (written commun., May 22, 1973).</p>
<p>About 4 miles below the Goose Neck, we enter Canyonlands
National Park and remain in the park almost to the north end of
Lake Powell.</p>
<p>About 6&frac12; miles into the park, at the north end of a bend much
like the Goose Neck, is the mouth of Lathrop Canyon, where
many boaters stop for lunch and where a side road connects with
the White Rim Trail (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>).</p>
<p>Six and one half miles below Lathrop Canyon is the mouth of
Rustler Canyon, which is joined near its mouth by Indian
Creek&mdash;the creek followed by the highway leading to The
Needles from U.S. 163. Within an airline distance of only 3
miles, the lower reach of Indian Creek, an intermittent stream,
flows past four small rincons, three of which (<a href="#fig73">fig. 73</a>) are within
an airline distance of only 0.8 mile. The stream has cut its new
channel into the red sandstones and shales of the Cutler Formation
only 15 to 20 feet deeper than the abandoned ones in the two
rincons at the left in <a href="#fig73">figure 73</a> and only about 25 feet deeper than
the one on the right. These figures suggest, at least to me, that
these cutoffs probably occurred sometime during the Holocene
Epoch, or age of man&mdash;that is, probably within the last 10,000
years (<a href="#fig80">fig. 80</a>). A detailed study of these rincons might change
this estimate, particularly if, say, buried driftwood or other carbonaceous
material could be found for an age determination by
the radiocarbon method.</p>

</div>
<p>About 5 miles below the mouth of Rustler Canyon and Indian
Creek, and also about 5 miles above the confluence, is The
Loop&mdash;an even sharper and more symmetrical figure eight than
Bowknot Bend of the Green River (<a href="#fig62">fig. 62</a>). An aerial view of The
Loop (<a href="#fig74">fig. 74</a>) shows that the channels on the south loop are only
about 500 feet apart and that those on the north loop are only
about 1,700 feet apart. At the narrowest places, both saddles are
considerably eroded&mdash;the southern one is only about 150 feet
above the river, but the northern one is still about 350 feet
above. Erosion of both saddles has been hastened by the facts
that the axis of the Meander anticline (see <a href="#Page_108">p. 108</a>) passes through
each saddle and that an interesting reverse fault (<a href="#fig75">fig. 75</a>) passes
through the lower and thinner southern saddle. The differences
between reverse and normal faults are shown by comparing
figures <a href="#fig56">56</a> and <a href="#fig76">76</a>. It seems inevitable that some day the small
saddle will be cut through by the Colorado River, and a new rincon
will result. Eventually, the other loop also probably will be
abandoned. As one of my colleagues remarked, how wonderful it
would seem, to be present at the proper moment to witness such
an event, particularly if one had a time-lapse movie camera to
record it for posterity!</p>

<p>About a mile and a half below the south saddle of The Loop we
meet the mouth of Salt Creek, which drains a large part of the
Needles district. <a href="#fig77">Figure 77</a> was taken in Salt Creek canyon
about 2 airline miles above the mouth looking southeast toward
Six-Shooter Peaks and Shay Mountain, northernmost of the
Abajo Mountains, on the horizon.</p>
<p>A mile and a half above the confluence is The Slide, a jumbled
mass of angular blocks of rock that fell from the northwest canyon
wall and originally probably extended all the way to the
southeast bank of the river. As shown in <a href="#fig78">figure 78</a>, it still extends
nearly across the river, leaving only a narrow deep chute
along the southeast bank. Just after the photograph was taken,
we hit rough fast water in the chute, with waves about 2 feet
high. At higher stages of the river, progressively more of The
Slide is covered by water, and there is less tendency for waves to
form. The date of this landslide is not known, but it is shown on
a map by Herron (1917, pl. 22A) made prior to 1917 and may well
have occurred during prehistoric times.</p>
<p>Soon we reach the confluence of the Green and Colorado
Rivers (figs. <a href="#fig59">59</a>, <a href="#fig60">60</a>). This important junction of two mighty
rivers was noted by all previous voyagers, but their impressions
of it differed considerably. Powell (1875, p. 56) remarked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These streams unite in solemn depths, more than one thousand two hundred feet
below the general surface of the country. The walls of the lower end of Stillwater
Ca&ntilde;on are very beautifully curved [see
<a href="#fig67">fig. 67</a>], as the river sweeps in its
meandering course. The lower end of the ca&ntilde;on through which the Grand comes
down, is also regular, but much more direct, and we look up this stream, and out
into the country beyond, and obtain glimpses of snow clad peaks, the summits of
a group of mountains known as the Sierra La Sal [La Sal Mountains]. Down the
Colorado, the ca&ntilde;on walls are much broken.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dellenbaugh (1902, p. 277) gave a fuller description but concluded:
&ldquo;In every way the Junction is a desolate place&rdquo;&mdash;an appraisal
with which I disagree. The most colorful account I have
read is that of Captain Francis Marion Bishop, a member of
Powell&rsquo;s 1871 expedition, who recorded in his journal for
September 15, 1871 (1947, p. 202):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, we are at last, after many days of toil and labor, here at the confluence of
the two great arteries of this great mountain desert. No more shall our frail
boats dash through thy turbid waters, Old Green, and no more shall we press on
to see the dark flood from the peaks and parks of Colorado. Grand and Green
here sink to thy rest, and from thy grave the <i>Colorado de Grande</i> shall flow on
forever, and on thy bosom henceforth will we battle with rock and wave. One
can hardly tell which is the largest of the two rivers. Neither seems to flow into
the other, but there seems to be a blending of both, and from their union rolls the
Colorado River.</p>

<p>Cataract Canyon heads at the confluence, but the rapids do
not appear until we leave Spanish Bottom some 3&frac12; miles below.
Between The Loop and Spanish Bottom, the Colorado River
follows closely the axis of an anticline. Along this reach the rock
strata dip downward away from the river, as shown in <a href="#fig61">figure 61</a>.
This fold was noted by Powell and some of his men, and Bishop
(1947, p. 203) reported in his journal for September 16, 1871:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He [Steward] is at a loss how to account for the folded appearance of the strata
here. But doubtless will find some explanation. Says the dip recedes from the
river ca&ntilde;on, and thinks it is a fissure. Maj. [Powell] thinks it is owing to an upheaval,
and that the beds next to the river have broken up from the mass, etc.,
etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Forty-four years later Harrison (1927) named this structure the
Meander anticline and concluded that the weight of the rocks on
each side of the river had squeezed underlying beds of salt in the
Paradox Member of the Hermosa Formation and caused them to
move upward along the river, where the confining strata had
been removed by erosion. Harrison&rsquo;s theory was accepted by
Baker (1933) and most later workers in the area. Thus we have
what may be termed an erosional anticline, whose axis, or crest,
follows the river. Erosional anticlines also occur elsewhere, as
along the Eagle and Roaring Fork valleys of central Colorado.
Mutschler and Hite (1969) suggested that this zone of weakness
in Canyonlands overlies and follows a break in the hard Precambrian
(<a href="#fig80">fig. 80</a>) rocks that underlie the area at great depth. At any
rate, Powell was on the right track even though he was totally
unaware of the underlying salt or the deep-seated fault.</p>
<p>Smooth water continues from the confluence to Spanish Bottom,
where the Old Spanish Trail comes down to the river from
the west and continues up Lower Red Lake Canyon to the east.
As mentioned earlier, this is about the south end of the Meander
anticline, and an intruded chunk of the Paradox Member, mostly
gypsum, occupies part of the mouth of Lower Red Lake Canyon,
as shown in <a href="#fig79">figure 79</a>.</p>
<p>The remaining 10 miles or so of Cataract Canyon within
Canyonlands National Park contains many rapids and should be
traversed only under the leadership of experienced river guides.
If and when Lake Powell reaches its maximum level, it will extend
to within about a mile of the park, but at present (1973) it
heads near the mouth of Gypsum Canyon, about 5 miles below
the park.</p>

primitive animals that evolved in the sea during the vast Precambrian Era left few traces

skeletal parts became abundant during and after the Paleozoic Era. (Fig. 80)</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p class="center">The Age of the Earth</p>
<p>The Earth is very old&mdash;four and a half billion years or more
according to recent estimates. Most of the evidence for an ancient
Earth is contained in the rocks that form the Earth&rsquo;s crust. The rock
layers themselves&mdash;like pages in a long and complicated History&mdash;record
the surface-shaping events of the past, and buried within them
are traces of life&mdash;the plants and animals that evolved from organic
structures that existed perhaps three billion years ago.</p>
<p>Also contained in rocks once molten are radioactive elements
whose isotopes provide earth scientists with an atomic clock. Within
these rocks, &ldquo;parent&rdquo; isotopes decay at a predictable rate to form
&ldquo;daughter&rdquo; isotopes. By determining the relative amounts of parent
and daughter isotopes, the age of these rocks can be calculated.</p>
<p>Thus the results of studies of rock layers (stratigraphy), and of the
progressive development of life (paleontology), coupled with the ages
of certain rocks as measured by atomic clocks (geochronology), attest
to a very old Earth!</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/pmg110.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="229" />
</div>
<p>Having finished our geologic ramble through Canyonlands
National Park, let us see how this pile of eroded rocks fit into the
bigger scheme of things&mdash;the geologic age and events of the
earth as a whole, as depicted in <a href="#fig80">figure 80</a>. As shown in <a href="#fig9">figure 9</a>,
the rock strata still preserved in the park range in age from
Pennsylvanian to Jurassic, or from about 300 to 175 million
years ago, a span of about 125 million years. This seems an incredibly
long time, until you note that the earth is some 4.5
billion years old and that our rock pile is but one twenty-fifth,
or 4 percent, of the age of the earth as a whole. Thus, in <a href="#fig80">figure 80</a>
the rocks exposed in the park occupy only about the left-hand
third of the top whorl of the spiral.</p>
<p>But this is not the whole story. As indicated earlier, about
10,000 feet of younger Mesozoic and Tertiary rocks that once
covered the area have been carried away by erosion, and if we include
these, the span is increased to about 250 million years, or
nearly a full whorl of the spiral.</p>
<p>Deep tests for oil and gas tell us that much older rocks underlie
the area, and we have seen that some of these rocks played
a part in shaping the park we see today&mdash;note the breaks in the
deep-seated Precambrian rocks and the salt in the Paradox
Member. In addition to the Precambrian igneous and
metamorphic rocks, there are about 2,000 feet of Paleozoic sedimentary
rocks older than the Pennsylvanian Paradox Member.
Most of these sedimentary rocks were laid down in ancient seas
during Cambrian, Ordovician, Devonian, Mississippian, and
Pennsylvanian times (<a href="#fig80">fig. 80</a>). There are some gaps in the rock
record caused by temporary emergence of the land above sea
level and erosion of the land surface before the land again subsided
below sea level so that deposition could resume. Silurian
rocks are absent altogether, presumably because here the
Silurian Period was dominated by erosion rather than deposition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>While Pennsylvanian and Permian sediments were being
deposited in and southwest of the park, a large area to the
northeast&mdash;called by geologists the Uncompahgre highland,
because it occupied the same general area as the present Uncompahgre
Plateau&mdash;rose slowly above sea level. Whatever
Paleozoic rocks there were on this rising land, plus part of the
underlying Precambrian rocks, were eroded and carried by
streams into deep basins to the northeast and southwest. Thus,
while mostly marine or nearshore deposits were being laid down
in and near the park, thousands of feet of red beds were being
laid down by streams in an area between the park and the Uncompahgre
Plateau. During part of Middle Pennsylvanian time
a large area including the park and known as the Paradox Basin
was alternately connected to or cut off from the sea, so the water
evaporated during cutoff periods and was replenished during
periods when connection with the sea resumed. In this huge
evaporation basin were deposited the layers of salt and gypsum
plus some potash salts and shale that now make up the Paradox
Member.</p>
<p>The old Uncompahgre highland continued to shed debris into
the bordering basins until Triassic time, when it began to acquire
a veneer of red sandstone and siltstone of the Chinle Formation
(Lohman, 1965). The area remained above sea level during
the Triassic Period and most if not all the Jurassic Period,
although the Jurassic Carmel Formation was laid down in a sea
that lay just to the west.</p>
<p>Late in the Cretaceous Period a large part of central and
southeastern United States, including the eastern half of Utah,
sank beneath the sea, as shown in <a href="#fig81">figure 81</a>, and received
thousands of feet of mud, silt, and some sand that later compacted
into the Mancos Shale. This formation and all the
younger and some older strata have long since been eroded from
the park area but are present in adjacent areas, such as the
lower slopes of the Book Cliffs north of Green River, Crescent
Junction, and Cisco (<a href="#fig7">fig. 7</a>).</p>
<p>The land rose above the sea at about the close of the
Cretaceous and has remained above ever since, although inland
basins and lakes received sediment during parts of the Tertiary
Period. Compressive forces in the earth&rsquo;s crust produced some
gentle folding of the strata at the close of the Cretaceous, but
more pronounced folding and some faulting occurred during the
Eocene Epoch, when most of the Rocky Mountains took form.
During the Miocene Epoch molten igneous rock welled up into
the strata to form the cores of the nearby La Sal, Abajo, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
Henry Mountains (<a href="#fig7">fig. 7</a>). Additional uplift and some folding occurred
in the Pliocene and Pleistocene Epochs.</p>

<p class="pcap">LATE CRETACEOUS SEA, which covered parts of central and southeastern United
States. (Fig. 81)</p>
</div>
<p>Much of the course of the Colorado River was established in
the Miocene Epoch, with some additional adjustments in the late
Pliocene and early Pleistocene Epochs (Hunt, 1969, p. 67). Erosion
during much of the Tertiary Period and all of the Quaternary
Period, combined with some sagging and breaking of the
crust brought on by solution and lateral squeezing of salt beds
beneath The Needles, The Grabens, and the Meander anticline,
produced the landscape as we now see it.</p>
<p>The Precambrian rocks beneath the area are about 1.5 billion
years old, so an enormous span of time is represented by the
rocks and events in and beneath Canyonlands National Park.</p>
<p>If we consider the geologic formations that make up the
Colorado Plateau&mdash;including national parks (N.P.), national
monuments (N.M.) (excluding small historical or archeological
ones), Monument Valley, San Rafael Swell, and Glen Canyon
National Recreation Area&mdash;certain formations or groups of formations
play starring roles in some parks or monuments, some
play supporting roles, and in a few places the entire cast of rocks
gets about equal billing. Let us compare them and see how and
where they fit into the geologic time spiral (<a href="#fig80">fig. 80</a>).</p>
<p>Dinosaur N. M., with exposed rocks ranging in age from
Precambrian to Cretaceous, represents the greatest time span
(nearly 2 billion years) but has one unit&mdash;the Jurassic Morrison
Formation&mdash;in the starring role, for this unit contains the many
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
dinosaur fossils that give the monument its name and fame;
several older units have supporting roles. Grand Canyon N. P.
and N. M. are next, with rocks from Precambrian through Permian
(excluding the Quaternary lava flows in the N. M.), but
here there is truly a team effort, for the entire cast gets about
equal billing. Canyonlands N. P. stands third in size of cast, with
rocks ranging from Pennsylvanian to Jurassic, but we would
have to give top billing to the Permian Cedar Mesa Sandstone
Member of the Cutler Formation, from which The Needles, The
Grabens, and most of the arches were sculptured; the Triassic
Wingate Sandstone and Kayenta Formation get second billing
for their roles in forming and preserving Island in the Sky and
other high mesas.</p>
<p>Now let us consider those with only one or few players in the
cast, beginning at the bottom of the time spiral. Black Canyon of
the Gunnison N. M., cut entirely in rocks of early Precambrian
age (except for only a veneer of much younger rocks), obviously
has but one star in its cast. Colorado N. M. contains rocks ranging
from Precambrian to Cretaceous&mdash;equal to Dinosaur in this
respect&mdash;but it is unique in that all the rocks of the long
Paleozoic Era and some others are missing from the cast; of
those that remain, the Triassic Wingate and Kayenta are the
stars, with strong support from the Jurassic Entrada Sandstone.</p>
<p>All the bridges in Natural Bridges N. M. were carved from the
Permian Cedar Mesa Sandstone, also the star in Canyonlands N.
P. In Canyon de Chelly (pronounced &ldquo;dee shay&rdquo;) N. M. and
Monument Valley (neither N. P. nor N. M., as it is owned and
administered by the Navajo Tribe), the de Chelly Sandstone
Member of the Cutler Formation&mdash;a Permian member younger
than the Cedar Mesa&mdash;plays the starring role.</p>
<p>Wupatki N. M., near Flagstaff, Ariz., stars the Triassic
Moenkopi Formation. Petrified Forest N. P. (which now includes
part of the Painted Desert) also has but one star&mdash;the Triassic
Chinle Formation, with its many petrified logs and stumps of
ancient trees. The Triassic-Jurassic Glen Canyon Group (<a href="#fig9">fig. 9</a>),
which includes the Triassic Wingate Sandstone and Kayenta
Formation and the Triassic-Jurassic Navajo Sandstone, receives
top billing in recently enlarged Capitol Reef N. P., but the
Triassic Moenkopi and Chinle Formations enjoy supporting
roles.</p>
<p>The Triassic-Jurassic Navajo Sandstone, erosional remnants
of which are found on the high mesas of Canyonlands N. P., is
the undisputed star of Zion N. P., Rainbow Bridge N. M., and
Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, despite the fact that the
latter is the type locality of the entire Glen Canyon Group (<a href="#fig9">fig. 9</a>).
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
The Navajo also forms the impressive reef at the eastern edge
of the beautiful San Rafael Swell (a dome, or closed anticline,
<a href="#fig7">fig. 7</a>), now crossed by Highway I-70 between Green River and
Fremont Junction, Utah.</p>
<p>As we journey upward in the time spiral (<a href="#fig80">fig. 80</a>), we come to
the Jurassic Entrada Sandstone, which stars in Arches N. P.,
with help from the underlying Navajo Sandstone and a supporting
cast of both older and younger rocks. The Entrada also forms
the grotesque erosional forms called &ldquo;hoodoos and goblins&rdquo; in
Goblin Valley State Park, north of Hanksville, Utah.</p>
<p>Moving ever upward in the spiral, we come to the
Cretaceous&mdash;the age of the starring Mesaverde Group, whose
caves in Mesa Verde N. P. now house beautifully preserved ruins
once occupied by the Anasazi, the same ancient people who once
dwelt in Canyonlands N. P.</p>
<p>This brings us up to the Tertiary Period, during the early part
of which the pink limestones and shales of the Paleocene and
Eocene Wasatch Formation were laid down in inland basins.
Beautifully sculptured cliffs, pinnacles, and caves of the
Wasatch star in Bryce Canyon N. P. and nearby Cedar Breaks N.
M. This concludes our climb up the time spiral, except for
Quaternary volcanoes and some older volcanic features at
Sunset Crater N. M., near Flagstaff, Ariz.</p>
<p>Thus, one way or another, many geologic units that formed
during the last couple of billion years have performed on the
stage of the Colorado Plateau and, hamlike, still lurk in the
wings eagerly awaiting your applause to recall them to the
footlights. Don&rsquo;t let them down&mdash;visit and enjoy the national
parks and monuments of the Plateau, for they probably are the
greatest collection of scenic wonderlands in the world.</p>

<p>Many reports covering various aspects of the area have been
cited in the text by author and year, and these plus a few additional
ones are listed below under &ldquo;Selected References.&rdquo; A
few of general or special interest should be mentioned, however.</p>
<p>Between 1926 and 1931 virtually the entire area now included
in the park was mapped geologically in three classic
reports&mdash;two by Baker (1933, 1946) and one by McKnight (1940).
These men and their field assistants mapped the area by use of
the plane table and telescopic alidade without benefit of modern
topographic maps or aerial photographs, except for topographic
maps of narrow stretches along the Green and Colorado Rivers
made under the direction of Herron (1917). Only small sections
could be reached by automobile, so nearly all the area was
traversed using horses or by hiking.</p>
<p>During the uranium boom of the early and middle 1950&rsquo;s, the
U.S. Geological Survey remapped the topography of most of the
area at a scale of 1:24,000 and also remapped the geology of
much of the area at this same scale. The southern part of the
Needles district was mapped by Lewis and Campbell (1965). The
geologic mapping west of the Green and Colorado Rivers was
done by F. A. McKeown, P. P. Orkild, C. C. Hawley, and others;
that east of the Colorado River and a little between the two
rivers was done by E. N. Hinrichs and others. Only four of the
geologic maps have been published (Hinrichs and others, 1967,
1968, 1971a, b), but all this work and the older reports were used
by Williams (1964) in compiling the 1:250,000-scale geologic map
of the Moab quadrangle, by Williams and Hackman (1971) in
compiling a similar map of the Salina quadrangle, and by
Haynes, Vogel, and Wyant (1972) in compiling a similar map of
the Cortez quadrangle. These three maps show the geology of
the entire park.</p>
<p>The 1970 issue of the Naturalist in which the cited papers by
Jennings, Newell, and Stokes appear also contains other papers
on Canyonlands National Park, including one on the plants.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>Several early reports on the Green and Colorado Rivers and
their potential utilization contain a wealth of information and
many fine photographs&mdash;two reports on the Colorado River by
La Rue (1916, 1925), one on the Green River by Wooley (1930),
and one on the upper Colorado River (above the confluence) by
Follansbee (1929).</p>
<p>For those who wish to learn more about the science of geology,
I suggest the textbook by Gilluly, Waters, and Woodford (1968).</p>
<h2 id="c34"><br /><span class="small">Acknowledgments</span></h2>
<p>My deep appreciation goes to Bates Wilson, former
superintendent of Canyonlands National Park, and to Joe
Carithers, former assistant superintendent, for their splendid
cooperation in supplying data and information and for making
available four-wheel-drive vehicles. I also wish to thank Chuck
Budge, former chief ranger; Dave May, assistant chief ranger;
Joe Miller, former maintenance engineer; Bob Kerr, new
superintendent; Maxine Newell, park historian and member of
the staff at Arches National Park; Jerry Banta, park ranger at
Arches; and Dave Minor, district ranger for the Needles district,
for their many favors.</p>
<p>I am grateful to several colleagues and friends for the loan of
photographs, for geologic help and data, and for reviewing this
report. I am also deeply grateful to my wife Ruth for accompanying
me on all the field work and for her help and encouragement.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
